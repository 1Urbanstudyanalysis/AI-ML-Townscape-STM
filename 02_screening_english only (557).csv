This study examines the impact of urban street landscape color characteristics on visitors’ emotional perceptions, providing insights for landscape planning. Focusing on Xi'an's inner-third ring road area, we use Full Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to create an visitors’ emotional perception dataset of street images. Machine learning techniques are employed to extract color features, construct quantitative color indexes, and visualize them spatially. Key findings include: (1) A spatial pattern where perceptions of beautiful and lively increase and depressing decreases from city centers, suggesting similarities between visitors' and residents' emotional responses; (2) A complex, non-linear relationship between color features and emotional perception, with optimal responses at color complexity 0.86 and coordination 0.84; (3) More pronounced color characteristics positively affect visitor emotions under non-routine conditions. Theoretically, this study confirms that vibrant environments enhance visitor experiences. Methodologically, it extends tourism studies by integrating streetscape big data and machine learning, moving beyond traditional text-based analysis. The results offer city managers valuable insights into visual preferences for streetscapes, aiding in the optimization of urban landscape design. © The Author(s) 2025.",Color features; Emotional perception; Fully Convolutional Networks; Machine learning; Random Forests; Streetscape images,Adversarial machine learning; Color vision; Decision trees; Machine learning; Random forests; Color characteristics; Color features; Convolutional networks; Emotional experiences; Emotional perception; Fully convolutional network; Machine-learning; Streetscape image; Urban tourisms; Convolutional neural networks,,,,,"Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42071169, 42471265, 42271468); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant numbers 42071169, 42471265 and 42271468, and Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province, grant number.2019ZDLSF07-04.","Barnes, Stuart J., In living color?

While urban planning and design are known to influence road safety, it is not clear how features of the built environment contribute to traffic fatalities. In this study, we analyze road fatality data from 106 cities across six continents via a combination of computer vision and unsupervised clustering on 26.8 million Google Street View images. We use deep learning tools to extract 25 features from the images. Among these features, 19 are relatively static built environment features, and 6 are dynamic usage-related features (such as pedestrians, cars, buses, and bikes). On the basis of the built environment features, we group the urban streetscapes into six distinct visual clusters. We then examine how these clusters are related to city-level road fatality rates when various control variables (e.g., population size, carbon emissions, income, road length, road safety policy, and continent) and dynamic features are combined. Our findings show that cities with Open Arterials streetscape (extensive road surface, open-sky views, and railings) tend to have higher road fatality rates. After accounting for differences in the built environment, cities with better public transit (proxied by buses detected) tend to have fewer traffic deaths—specifically, a 1% increase in bus presence is linked to a 0.35% decrease in fatalities per 100,000 people. This study demonstrates the power of using widely available street view imagery to uncover global disparities in urban design and their connection to road safety. © 2025 The Authors",Built environment; Image analysis; Road safety; Streetscape; Urban design; Urban visual clusters,Buses; Deep learning; Highway accidents; Highway planning; Mass transportation; Motor transportation; Pedestrian safety; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Built environment; Fatality rates; Global cities; Image analyze; Image-analysis; Road safety; Road transports; Streetscape; Urban design; Urban visual cluster; Image analysis,,,,,-17616221,This research is funded by the Research Grant Council General Research Fund (No. 17616221) and is an initiative of the HKU Joint Laboratory on Future Cities.,"Almasi, Seyed Ahmadreza, Pedestrian Crash Exposure Analysis Using Alternative Geographically Weighted Regression Models, Journal of Advanced Transportation, 2021, (2021); Ahmed, Ishtiaque, Road traffic accident characteristics in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Jurnal Teknologi, 71, 3, pp. 75-82, (2014); Ali, Yasir, A Bayesian generalised extreme value model to estimate real-time pedestrian crash risks at signalised intersections using artificial intelligence-based video analytics, Analytic Methods in Accident Research, 38, (2023); Alnawmasi, Nawaf, The impact of higher speed limits on the frequency and severity of freeway crashes: Accounting for temporal shifts and unobserved heterogeneity, Analytic Methods in Accident Research, 34, (2022); Ameratunga, Shanthi N., Road-traffic injuries: confronting disparities to address a global-health problem, The Lancet, 367, 9521, pp. 1533-1540, (2006); Amin-Naseri, Mostafa, Evaluating the Reliability, Coverage, and Added Value of Crowdsourced Traffic Incident Reports from Waze, Transportation Research Record, 2672, 43, pp. 34-43, (2018); Atlas of Urban Expansion, (2012); Barrington-Leigh, Christopher P., Global trends toward urban street-network sprawl, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117, 4, pp. 1941-1950, (2020); Batomen, Brice, Traffic-Calming Measures and Road Traffic Collisions and Injuries: A Spatiotemporal Analysis, American Journal of Epidemiology, 193, 5, pp. 707-717, (2024); Beaverstock, Jonathan V., A roster of world cities, Cities, 16, 6, pp. 445-458, (1999)","B.P.Y.

However, the characteristics of urban landscapes, such as high-density building distribution and heterogeneous building geometries, pose significant challenges in achieving pixel-level accuracy. To address these challenges, we proposed an innovative network for building extraction based on channel enhancement and multiscale spatial attention with ResNet (CRU-Net). First, CRU-Net employed U-Net as the core architecture, with ResNet34 as the encoder component. Second, to fully exploit the ability of convolutional neural networks to extract features at multiple scales, a new dilated residual block (DRB) was designed by combining a residual block with dilated convolution. Replacing the residual blocks in ResNet34 with DRB enhances the ability of CRU-Net to extract semantic information at different scales for building extraction. Next, the channel enhancement and multiscale spatial attention (CEMS) module was proposed and added to the skip connection of the network. CEMS is capable of learning more important features both spatially and channel-wise, enhancing the network's feature representation ability. Finally, a joint loss function combining normalized cross-correlation loss and binary cross-entropy loss was introduced to train the network, enabling it to focus on learning both global and local features of the building. The experiments show that CRU-Net achieves high accuracy and intersection over union (IoU) values on the Massachusetts building dataset, Inria aerial image labeling dataset, and WHU building dataset. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",attention; building extraction; deep learning; dilated convolution; remote sensing images,Antennas; Buildings; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Extraction; Network architecture; Semantics; Attention; Building extraction; Decisions makings; Deep learning; Dilated convolution; High-resolution remote sensing images; Image-based; Remote sensing images; Spatial attention; Urban form; Image enhancement; Remote sensing,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (42471120, 42261021); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 42471120 and 42261021).,"Srivastava, Vandita, Investigations on extraction of buildings from RS imagery using deep learning models, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 45, 1, pp. 68-100, (2024); Tan, Yihua, Multi-branch convolutional neural network for built-up area extraction from remote sensing image, Neurocomputing, 396, pp. 358-374, (2020); Chen, Junming, Depth Feature Fusion Network for Building Extraction in Remote Sensing Images, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 17, pp. 16577-16591, (2024); Liu, Yu, LFEMAP-Net: Low-Level Feature Enhancement and Multiscale Attention Pyramid Aggregation Network for Building Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 17, pp. 2718-2730, (2024); Hao, Ming, A Geometric Significance-Aware Deep Mutual Learning Network for Building Extraction from Aerial Images, Drones, 8, 10, (2024); El merabet, Youssef, Building roof segmentation from aerial images using a line-and region-based watershed segmentation technique, Sensors, 15, 2, pp. 3172-3203, (2015); Zhou, Guoqing, Building shadow detection on ghost images, Remote Sensing, 12, 4, (2020); Xia, Xiaotang, Building-Specific Recognition Algorithms Based on Image Sequence, IEEE Sensors Journal, 20, 20, pp. 12057-12064, (2020); Zhang, Meilin, Local-aware coupled network for hyperspectral image super-resolution, GIScience and Remote Sensing, 60, 1, (2023); Liu, Bo, Water extraction from optical high-resolution remote sensing imagery: a multi-scale feature extraction network with contrastive learning, GIScience and Remote Sensing, 60, 1, (2023)","W.

This can impede the development of targeted cooling strategies tailored to the specific characteristics of different street morphologies. This study quantifies street canyon morphology using street-view hemisphere images and compares multiple clustering models to identify the optimal model and parameters. Subsequently, machine learning is coupled with causal inference models to explore the associative mechanisms between different street canyon morphology indices and multi-time land surface temperature (LST). The results reveal that spectral clustering divides streets into three categories of wide streets and two categories of narrower alleys. Different street types exhibit distinct correlation trends with LST, highlighting the importance of clustering algorithms. In conjunction with the results of causal inference, it is observed that alleys with high canopy coverage and broad streets equipped with road-center hedges demonstrate superior cooling capabilities, with cooling effects of 23.56 % and 18.81 %, respectively. Conversely, for broad streets with lower levels of greening, increasing the height of roadside buildings can be an effective strategy to maximize the utilization of building shadows and wind for cooling purposes. This study emphasizes vegetation as a key factor in altering street canyon morphology to achieve cooling effects, particularly in stock developments. © 2025",Clustering algorithm; ECOSTRESS; SHAP values; Urban morphology,Cluster analysis; Computer integrated manufacturing; Cooling; Inference engines; Learning systems; Roads and streets; Causal inferences; Classification methods; Clusterings; Cooling effects; ECOSTRESS; Land surface temperature; Machine-learning; SHAP value; Street canyon; Urban morphology; Clustering algorithms; Morphology; algorithm; classification; comparative study; cooling; correlation; land surface; machine learning; quantitative analysis; street canyon; surface temperature; urban climate; urban design; urban geography; urban morphology; vegetation cover,,,,,"(2024YFHZ0220); Ministry of Education, MOE, (22YJCZH226); Ministry of Education, MOE","This work was supported by Sichuan International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Project (2024YFHZ0220), General project of humanities and social sciences of Ministry of Education (22YJCZH226).","Pena Acosta, Monica, Data-driven analysis of Urban Heat Island phenomenon based on street typology, Sustainable Cities and Society, 101, (2024); AlKhaled, Saud R., WebMRT: An online tool to predict summertime mean radiant temperature using machine learning, Sustainable Cities and Society, 115, (2024); Research Papers, (2015); Boser, Anna S., Validating spatio-temporal environmental machine learning models: Simpson’s paradox and data splits, Environmental Research Communications, 6, 3, (2024); van den Broeck, Guy, On the Tractability of SHAP Explanations, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 74, pp. 851-886, (2022); Chang, Yue, Urban thermal anisotropies by local climate zones: An assessment using multi-angle land surface temperatures from ECOSTRESS, Remote Sensing of Environment, 322, (2025); Chang, Yue, Monitoring diurnal dynamics of surface urban heat island for urban agglomerations using ECOSTRESS land surface temperature observations, Sustainable Cities and Society, 98, (2023); Chen, Jike, Quantifying the main and interactive effects of the dominant factors on the diurnal cycles of land surface temperature in typical urban functional zones, Sustainable Cities and Society, 114, (2024); Chen, Keyan, Evaluating the seasonal effects of building form and street view indicators on street-level land surface temperature using random forest regression, Building and Environment, 245, (2023); Chen, Yimin, Inferring the heterogeneous effect of urban land use on building height with causal machine learning, GIScience and Remote Sensing, 61, 1, (2024)","H.

Accurate estimation of rooftop PV power generation potential is hindered by shading effects induced by complex urban morphology, which significantly reduce solar irradiance on rooftop surfaces and lead to prediction errors. Traditional shading simulation methods are computationally expensive, underscoring the need for a nuanced equilibrium between computational efficiency and assessment accuracy. In this study, we introduce an innovative deep learning framework that effectively encodes a diverse array of spatiotemporal data sources to accurately predict shadow casting and calculate rooftop PV potential. Specifically, utilizing physics-based ground truth, the incorporation of the U-Net network along with three-dimensional (3D) building specifics, solar resource data, and meteorological parameters enables us to make precise forecasts regarding temporal changes in rooftop shadow patterns. This not only enhances computational efficiency but also ensures a high level of precision in power generation predictions. Experimental assessments carried out in Futian District, Shenzhen, reveal that shading effects alone result in an average energy loss of 5.32 % across rooftops. Moreover, our framework demonstrates superior performance compared to physics-based models, achieving an average Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.85 % for annual energy generation potential and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 89.23 % for shading effect evaluation. In addition, the proposed framework achieves approximately 158× and 65× speedup over traditional ray-casting and optimized ray-tracing methods respectively, highlighting its strong suitability for large-scale urban energy evaluations. Our contributions encompass the development of a novel deep learning framework for rooftop PV potential assessment, enhanced computational efficiency in urban analyses, and a resilient generalization capability with high accuracy across various urban settings. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Rooftop PV potential; Shadow prediction; Solar energy,Computational efficiency; Energy utilization; Urban planning; Deep learning; Energy; Learning frameworks; Learning methods; Photovoltaic potentials; Rooftop photovoltaic potential; Rooftop photovoltaic systems; Shading effect; Shadow prediction; Spatiotemporal feature; Solar fuels; alternative energy; building; computer simulation; equilibrium; error analysis; machine learning; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power generation; roof; shading; China; Futian; Guangdong; Shenzhen,,,,,"(P0047700, P0052733)","We are grateful for the support and funding from the following projects: the P0043885 - Flexibility of Urban Energy Systems (FUES) project, P0047700 - International Centre of Urban Energy Nexus, and P0052733 - RISUD: Cutting-edge Solar Synergies Integrated with 3D Urban Environments towards a Carbon-Neutral City, Hong Kong.","Gernaat, David E.H.J., Climate change impacts on renewable energy supply, Nature Climate Change, 11, 2, pp. 119-125, (2021); Jin, Yubin, Geographically constrained resource potential of integrating floating photovoltaics in global existing offshore wind farms, Advances in Applied Energy, 13, (2024); undefined, (2024); Gassar, Abdo Abdullah Ahmed, Review of geographic information systems-based rooftop solar photovoltaic potential estimation approaches at urban scales, Applied Energy, 291, (2021); Martinopoulos, Georgios, Are rooftop photovoltaic systems a sustainable solution for Europe?

Real estate development plays an important role in shaping urban landscapes, influencing spatial pattern, and socio-economic dynamics. Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), one of the fastest-growing metropolitan regions of India, provides a compelling case for understanding the drivers of real estate-induced urban expansion. This study aims to analyse the drivers of real estate induced urban expansion in Delhi NCR using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP NN) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. A comprehensive dataset comprising of physical, economic, demographic and spatial factors from 1990 to 2021 have been used for the analysis. The MLP NN model has been applied to assess the relative importance of drivers of real estate induced urban expansion in Delhi NCR. The results of MLP NN show that real estate expansion in Delhi NCR is primarily influenced by proximity factors, with the highest importance value of 0.21, observed for distance to regional centres (RC), followed by the distance to major centres (MC) at 0.16, and distance to utility services (US) at 0.14. Population density (0.12) and investment (0.08) also emerged as the main drivers. In contrast, physical factors like slope and elevation had the lowest significance values, 0.003 and 0.004, respectively are less important. The GWR model showed spatial heterogeneity in the influence of these drivers across the districts of Delhi NCR. The model exhibited high explanatory power, with an R2 value of 0.97 alongside an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of 416.49, which shows robustness of the model. This study highlights the significance of considering spatial heterogeneity in urban planning and policy formulation to address the dynamic nature of real estate-induced urban expansion for sustainable urban development. © King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Delhi NCR; Multicollinearity; Proximity factor; Real estate driver; Spatial heterogeneity,artificial intelligence; expansion; housing market; mapping method; spatial analysis; urban housing; Delhi; India,,,,,"University Grants Commission, UGC",The first author is thankful to University Grant Commission (UGC) for providing doctoral fellowship during this research work.,"Akaolisa, Casmir Zanders, EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT IN OWERRI, IMO STATE, NIGERIA: EMPHASIZING CHANGES IN LAND USE/LAND COVER (LULC), Journal of Landscape Ecology (Czech Republic), 16, 2, pp. 98-113, (2023); Basu, Tirthankar, Exploring the drivers of urban expansion in a medium-class urban agglomeration in India using the remote sensing techniques and geographically weighted models, Geography and Sustainability, 4, 2, pp. 150-160, (2023); Bloom, David E., Urbanization and the wealth of nations, Science, 319, 5864, pp. 772-775, (2008); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Cai, Zhaoyang, Real estate supports rapid development of China's urbanization, Land Use Policy, 95, (2020); Chandhiok, Gaurav, Perception analysis of attitude towards residential relocation in Delhi NCR(Region) with reference to metro connectivity, infrastructural availability, Polish Journal of Management Studies, 7, pp. 101-114, (2013); Chaudhuri, Gargi, Analyzing the dynamics of urbanization in Delhi National Capital Region in India using satellite image time-series analysis, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 49, 1, pp. 368-384, (2022); Economics and Computing Sciences, (2020); Eitelberg, David A., Demand for biodiversity protection and carbon storage as drivers of global land change scenarios, Global Environmental Change, 40, pp. 101-111, (2016); Fotheringham, A.

Remote sensing technology offers a unique capability for classifying and mapping trees across large areas; however, the accuracy of extracting and identifying individual trees remains challenging due to the limitations of available imagery and phenological variations. This study presents a novel integrated machine learning (ML) and Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) framework to enhance tree species classification in a botanical garden using multi-temporal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. High-resolution UAV imagery (2.3 cm/pixel) was acquired across four different seasons (summer, autumn, winter, and early spring) to incorporate the phenological changes. Spectral, textural, geometrical, and canopy height features were extracted using GEOBIA and then evaluated with four ML models (Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). Multi-temporal data significantly outperformed single-date imagery, with RF achieving the highest overall accuracy (86%, F1-score 0.85, kappa 0.83) compared to 57–75% for single-date classifications. Canopy height and textural features were dominant for species identification, indicating the importance of structural variations. Despite the limitations of moderate sample size and a controlled botanical garden setting, this approach offers a robust framework for forest and urban landscape managers as well as remote sensing professionals, by optimizing UAV-based strategies for precise tree species identification and mapping to support urban and natural forest conservation. © 2025 by the authors.",biodiversity; canopy height; forest conservation; GOBIA; high resolution; remote sensing,,,,,,"Food and Health Bureau, FHB; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee; Innovation and Technology Commission, ITC; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKPU, (152318/22E, 152344/23E); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKPU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42330717); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to all those who contributed to this work.

In this context, Nature-Based Solutions (NbSs), especially Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDSs), have emerged as viable strategies to enhance water resilience and sustainability. However, the literature still lacks standardized and scalable methodologies for their design and performance monitoring. This study conducts a systematic review following the PRISMA protocol, combined with bibliometric and co-occurrence analyses, to identify prevailing approaches in the sizing and monitoring of NbS-based SUDSs. Based on the peer-reviewed literature indexed in Scopus and Web of Science from 2020 to 2024, the findings reveal an increasing integration of hydrological modeling with artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and IoT-based real-time monitoring. Despite this progress, challenges remain in methodology validation, data availability, and system adaptability.

Flood detection plays a pivotal role in disaster management, necessitating advanced methodologies to enhance accuracy and efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires delineating flood extent at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Efforts to fully quantify urban flood distribution utilizing the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries in a cloud-based platform have ample potential but have yet to produce viable results in the urban landscape. Flood detection has been a challenging task in urban areas due to limitations of spatial-temporal resolution and complex back scatter mechanisms in urban settings. However, advancement in big-data and cloud-computing, data acquisition, satellite image processing and predictive analysis are rapidly becoming more accessible. Building on recent advancements, this study presents an analysis of methods exploring and comparing identification of flooded areas in urban and peri-urban locations, which has not been fully described. Using Houston, TX to test these methods, we compare flood maps generated from multiple classification method including constant threshold Change Detection Approach (CDA), Otsu method, and Machine Learning (ML) classification with Random Forest (RF) model using Sentinel-1 SAR images in Google Earth Engine (GEE). An extensive performance evaluation is conducted, including accuracy assessments, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The CDA approach shows the highest accuracy in peri-urban areas, while ML classifier outperforms both CDA and Otsu in urban settings. The analysis in this paper contributes to the development of flood detection methodologies in support of urban flood management. © 2025 Al Mehedi et al.

This study pro-poses a data-driven framework that integrates street view imagery, deep learning-based semantic segmentation, and machine learning interpretation models including SHAP analysis to explore the relationship between urban spatial characteristics and subjective perceptions. A total of 12,604 street-level images from Xi’an, China, were analyzed to ex-tract seven spatial indicators. These indicators were then linked with perceptual data across six emotional dimensions derived from the Place Pulse 2.0 dataset.

The potential application of this work lies in guiding urban planners, designers, and policymakers in leveraging AI technologies—such as sentiment analysis, participatory design platforms, and computer vision—to create more inclusive, responsive, and data-informed urban environments. By integrating HCAI into placemaking, cities can better align public space development with the needs, behaviors, and values of diverse communities, ultimately contributing to more vibrant, equitable, and sustainable urban life. Artificial intelligence (AI) for placemaking holds the potential to revolutionize how we conceptualize, design, and manage urban spaces to create more vibrant, resilient, and people-centered cities. In this context, integrating Human-Centered AI (HCAI) into public infrastructure presents an exciting opportunity to reimagine the role of urban amenities and furniture in shaping inclusive, responsive, and technologically enhanced public spaces. This review examines the state-of-the-art in HCAI for placemaking, focusing on some of the main factors that must be analyzed to guide future technological research and development, such as (a) AI-driven tools for community engagement in the placemaking process, including sentiment analysis, participatory design platforms, and virtual reality simulations; (b) AI sensors and image recognition technology for analyzing user behaviors within public spaces to inform evidence-based urban design decisions; (c) the role of HCAI in enhancing community engagement in the placemaking process, focusing on tools and approaches that facilitate more inclusive and participatory design practices; and (d) the utilization of AI in analyzing and understanding user behaviors within public spaces, highlighting how these insights can inform more responsive and user-centric design decisions.

While many studies have investigated the impact of environmental factors on urban development through spatial association with land use types, studies on volumetric urban environments across diverse floor uses remain limited. This study applied geospatial intelligence to analyse the location characteristics of space uses, extracting 90 environment features to interpret intra-interactions of the complex urban system, providing insights into the shape of urban form and informing smart governance. Using tree-based AI ensemble algorithms, Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models, we examine the spatial effects of environmental factors on space parcels for being 15 different uses. Feature importance and partial dependence analysis of each space parcel for each factor assist in mapping the spatial suitability and provide insights into the determinants of space uses in mixed-use cities. Furthermore, we map the suitability of space parcels for residential, visitor accommodation, office and diet use, visualising the combined effect of environmental features.

To address this question, the research adopts a buffer-dependent workflow consisting of five steps: (1) Cooler Area Searching; (2) OTC Simulation; (3) Cross-scale Validation; (4) Cooler Area Identification; and (5) Space Design Analysis. At the methodology's core is a series of machine learning tools (e.g., Bayesian-optimized CatBoost models and Shapley Additive exPlanations) used to identify the optimal buffer and interpret the urban features that matter. The results showed that an optimal buffer range of 30 to 50 m accurately captures the thermal impacts of urban features across eight typical local climate zones (LCZs). Notably, urban features’ critical impact on OTC was highlighted, including percentage of view (PV), orientation of view (OV), average height index (AHI), and vegetation coverage (VE). For the first time, this research articulates the optimal buffer for urban features to maximize OTC in different LCZs.

While machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for exploring the relationship between park environments and crime, the opaque nature of many models has hindered insights into underlying mechanisms. Moreover, most existing studies have concentrated on parks in central urban areas, overlooking peri-urban parks that increasingly serve expanding metropolitan populations. To address these gaps, this study employs an interpretable machine learning approach, XGBoost with SHAP values, to examine how the environments of both urban and peri-urban parks in Wuhan, China, influence violent crime. We assess four domains of contextual variables: accessibility, built environment, land use, and socioeconomic conditions. Results indicate that while violent crime rates are generally higher in urban parks, park location itself is not a significant standalone predictor. Both accessibility and built environment factors demonstrate nonlinear and context-sensitive associations with violent crime. Despite the potential of environmental design in crime prevention, disadvantaged neighborhoods remain disproportionately affected by unsafe park conditions. These findings highlight the need for place-sensitive planning strategies and demonstrate the value of interpretable machine learning in advancing spatial crime analysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",Park environment; Urban park; Violent crime; Wuhan; XGBoost-SHAP method,accessibility; amenity; crime; machine learning; metropolitan area; neighborhood; park design; urban design; China; Hubei; Wuhan,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (42471276, 42171205); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF",This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (42471276; 42171205).,"Agrawal, Arun, Enchantment and disenchantment: The role of community in natural resource conservation, World Development, 27, 4, pp. 629-649, (1999); Beckett, Katherine A., Dealing with disorder: Social control in the post-industrial city, Theoretical Criminology, 12, 1, pp. 5-30, (2008); Bhatia, Shaun, Greenness and Crime in the City: An Investigation Using Remote Sensing and Spatial Panel Models, Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy, 16, 1, pp. 229-257, (2023); Boessen, Adam, Parks as crime inhibitors or generators: Examining parks and the role of their nearby context, Social Science Research, 76, pp. 186-201, (2018); Brueckner, Jan K., Gentrification and neighborhood housing Cycles: Will America's future downtowns be rich?, Review of Economics and Statistics, 91, 4, pp. 725-743, (2009); Burley, Blair Alexandra, Green infrastructure and violence: Do new street trees mitigate violent crime?, Health and Place, 54, pp. 43-49, (2018); Charney, Igal, Two visions of Suburbia: Mississauga City Centre and Heartland Business Community, Canadian Geographies/Geographies Canadiennes, 49, 2, pp. 214-220, (2005); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016); Chen, Guoyi, Environmental safety evaluation of geopark based on CPTED concept and fuzzy comprehensive analysis, PLOS ONE, 16, 11 November, (2021); Chen, Shudi, Urban Public Space Safety Perception and the Influence of the Built Environment from a Female Perspective: Combining Street View Data and Deep Learning, Land, 13, 12, (2024)","Y.

This study introduces a novel methodology for mapping and estimating RPV potential in Karachi, Pakistan, using earth observation data derived from satellite imagery. We developed a custom dataset of high-resolution satellite images capturing diverse solar panel configurations and employed an ensemble deep learning approach—combining UNet-ResNet50, DeepLabv3-ResNet50, Mask2Former-SwinTransformer, SamLoRA-vit_b, and PSPNet-ResNet50—to detect RPV installations with high precision. Through weighted majority voting, the ensemble model achieved superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to individual models, enhancing the reliability of geospatial mapping under variable urban and weather conditions. To estimate photovoltaic yield, we integrated spatiotemporal solar irradiance data with surface meteorological measurements, including ambient temperature, wind speed, and humidity, yielding an annual RPV potential of 602.83 GWh for Karachi, with a potential reduction of 0.37 megatons of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent. This GeoAI-driven framework serves as a foundational layer for an Urban Digital Twin, enabling dynamic modelling of RPV potential to support sustainable urban energy transitions. Additionally, we evaluated the economic feasibility of RPV deployment using levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) analysis. By advancing image processing and big spatiotemporal data analytics with GeoAI, this study provides a scalable framework for inventorying urban renewable energy resources, offering actionable insights for governance and sustainable land use planning. © 2025 The Authors",Earth Observation; GeoAI; Rooftop Photovoltaics (RPV); Sustainable Energy,alternative energy; artificial intelligence; mapping; photovoltaic system; roof; satellite imagery; Karachi; Pakistan; Sind,,,,,"Beihang University, BUAA; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2024 M764072); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","This work is support by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(2024 M764072).

Previous studies have explored urban flood susceptibility, yet a comprehensive approach that unifies these perspectives has remained underdeveloped. This study established a holistic framework using the SD-PLUS-LightGBM model with multiple variables under three SSP-RCP scenarios to predict spatial-temporal dynamics of flood susceptibility in the Greater Bay Area between 2030 and 2050. Compared with traditional models, LightGBM established superior predictive accuracy and operational reliability for urban flood susceptibility mapping. The results indicated a non-linear expansion of high-susceptibility zones, with SSP5–8.5 projections showing a two-fold increase in vulnerable areas by 2050 relative to 2020 baselines. Regions experiencing pronounced susceptibility transitions were expected to grow significantly (0.23 % of the total area), concentrated in historic urban cores and peri‑urban interfaces.

Using customized DALL-E 3 interfaces, we facilitated engagement sessions with members of an academic planning community to assess their perceptions of AI-generated imagery before and after its use, with a focus on main street revitalization (n = 24 qualitative, n = 17 quantitative). Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model, we assessed cognitive, operational, and participatory dimensions influencing user attitudes toward AI-assisted urban design. Perceived usefulness in cognitive and participatory tasks emerged as the strongest predictors of attitudes toward visual GenAI use, explaining up to 71% and 44% of the variance, respectively. While participants valued the ability to generate visuals and stimulate dialogue rapidly, challenges with prompt precision, output predictability, and interface usability limited broader accessibility. User expertise moderated perceptions, with higher proficiency participants generally expressing more positive attitudes toward its use. Our preliminary findings suggest that while visual GenAI may offer new opportunities to augment cognitive and co-design processes, its integration into city design workflows may also depend on diverse training datasets to address biases; human-centered design with clearer affordances and support for non-expert users; and, validation processes that maintain human oversight. This study contributes to the emerging research on human-AI work integration by providing initial empirical evidence on the opportunities and constraints of visual GenAI tools in city design contexts, while establishing a foundation for future research. © The Author(s) 2025.",Generative AI; Human-AI collaboration; Human-computer interaction; Human-in-the-loop; Planning support systems; Technology acceptance; Urban design,Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Engineering research; Urban planning; User centered design; City designs; Computer interaction; Design workflow; Generative AI; Human-AI collaboration; Human-in-the-loop; Planning support systems; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; Urban design; Human computer interaction,,,,,"Fulbright Canada, FC",Funding text 1: 'Open Access funding provided by the MIT Libraries'.

However, most previous studies have concentrated on the macro-level aspects of the built environment, such as land-use mix, while overlooking the street-space quality characteristics that influence cyclists’ on-site perceptions. Although research has explored the role of objective visual features, studies on the audiovisual environment of streets and its perceived impact remain scarce. This study combines street view imagery, Strava Heatmap data, and interpretable machine learning to investigate the nonlinear and interactive effects of street-level spatial quality on cycling volumes. The results indicate that (1) auditory characteristics—especially noise intensity and sound quality—exert a significant and often stronger influence on cycling volume than visual features alone, challenging visual-centric planning assumptions; (2) several spatial features show nonlinear or threshold effects (e.g., green view index and soundscape eventfulness exhibit inverted U-shaped curves), indicating that excessive environmental richness may reduce cycling appeal (3) synergistic and antagonistic interactions exist between visual and auditory elements—for instance, natural sounds can mitigate the negative impact of high noise, while enclosed visual environments amplify it. These findings provide empirical evidence that optimizing—rather than maximizing—street-level sensory stimuli is essential for promoting active travel. Building on this insight, our study offers practical guidance for policymakers and urban designers to implement more targeted and context-sensitive interventions, and underscores the potential of integrating audiovisual design into sustainable transport planning. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Cycling volume; Machine learning; Spatial quality; Street view images,Acoustic intensity; Acoustic noise; Audiovisual; Image quality; Land use; Machine learning; Sound reproduction; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Built environment; Cycling behavior; Cycling volume; Machine-learning; Nonlinear effect; Quality characteristic; Spatial quality; Street view image; Transport environment; Visual feature; Learning systems; acoustics; cycle transport; imagery; machine learning; noise; nonlinearity; policy making; spatial analysis; threshold; transportation planning; urban design,,,,,"China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202306120267, 202108050061); China Scholarship Council, CSC",This research was funded by the China Scholarship Council (No. 202306120267 and No. 202108050061).,"undefined; Aletta, Francesco, Influence of personal factors on sound perception and overall experience in urban green areas.

The framework, developed within the Computational Urban Sustainability Platform (CUSP), addresses the limitations of traditional static LCA by enabling continuous, data-driven sustainability assessments. Incorporating predictive modelling, BLDT empowers stakeholders with timely insights into energy use, emissions, and health and safety performance, supporting proactive environmental decision-making. Validated through a case study at the Port of Grimsby, the BLDT framework facilitated a 25% reduction in energy consumption while enhancing operational efficiency.

This study introduces a deep learning framework to predict spatio-temporal flow behavior in street canyons with varying geometric configurations and upstream roughness conditions. A convolutional encoder–decoder transformer model, trained on particle image velocimetry (PIV) data from wind tunnel experiments, is employed with autoregressive training to predict flow characteristics. The training dataset contains diverse flow regimes, with a focus on the wall-parallel plane near the canyon roof, a critical region for pollutant exchange between the outer flow and the canyon interior. The model accurately reproduces key flow features, including mean turbulent statistics, two-point correlations, quadrant analysis, and dominant flow structures, while demonstrating strong agreement with experimental data in capturing the temporal evolution of flow dynamics. These findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models to enhance predictive capabilities for urban canyon flows, offering a pathway toward improved urban design, sustainable environmental management, and more effective pollutant dispersion modeling. © 2025",Deep generative models; Experimental data; Turbulence prediction; Urban flows,Ecodesign; Energy conservation; Environmental design; Environmental management; Environmental monitoring; Environmental remediation; Green computing; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Complex dynamics; Deep generative model; Experimental data; Generative model; High dimensionality; Pollutant dispersions; Street canyon flows; Turbulence prediction; Turbulence structures; Urban flow; Air quality,,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-22-1-2150); Office of Naval Research, ONR","Partial support of ONR, United States under grant N00014-22-1-2150 is gratefully acknowledged.

However, the majority of existing approaches suffered from two limitations. First, prior research has provided empirical evidence of negative environmental impacts that infrastructure can incur, while infrastructure provision inequality assessment has not taken those environmental concerns into consideration. Second, comprehensive provision assessment for multi-infrastructure system calls for a proper weight assignment, while current studies either determine the infrastructure components as equal weights or rely on subjective methods (e.g. AHP), which may be affected by potential biases. This study proposes a novel approach for incorporating environmental considerations into quantifying and assessing infrastructure provision in cities based on a data-driven method. We applied an interpretable machine learning method (XGBoost + SHAP) to capture the relationship between infrastructure features and environmental hazards (i.e., air pollution and urban heat), and then determined feature weights as their relative contributions towards environmental hazards when calculating infrastructure provision. The implementation of the model in five metropolitan areas in the U.S. demonstrates the capability of the proposed approach in characterizing inequality in infrastructure. Further the study reveals both spatial and income inequality regarding infrastructure provision. Environmentally integrated infrastructure provision proposed in this study can better capture the intersection of infrastructure development and environmental justice in measuring and characterizing infrastructure inequality in cities. This study could be used effectively to inform integrated urban design strategies to promote infrastructure equity and environmental justice based on data-driven and machine learning-based insights. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Data-driven; Environmental burden; Environmental justice; Infrastructure inequality; Infrastructure provision; Interpretable machine learning,Air quality; Data driven; Environmental burdens; Environmental considerations; Environmental hazards; Environmental justice; Infrastructure inequality; Infrastructure provision; Interpretable machine learning; Machine-learning; Urban development; Urban growth; environmental assessment; environmental conditions; environmental justice; machine learning; metropolitan area; spatiotemporal analysis; United States,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1846069); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant CMMI-1846069 (CAREER).

Mobility network structures derived from census-based commute data significantly enhance modeling performance for socioeconomic modeling, even without using region-specific features. The proposed deep learning framework employing Graph Neural Networks outperforms traditional models using regional-level features across 12 major U.S. cities. What is the implication of the main finding? Network-based representations derived from deep learning methods offer a powerful alternative to traditional location-based approaches for urban analysis and forecasting of population-based metrics. The approach provides urban researchers and policymakers with scalable tools to incorporate mobility-driven structural and topological network effects—derived purely from commuting patterns—into socioeconomic planning and decision-making. Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban modeling methods do not account for network-based effects. Additionally, network-based research has explored a multitude of data from urban landscapes. However, achieving a comprehensive understanding of urban mobility proves challenging without exhaustive datasets. In this study, we propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures provide significant predictive performance without considering any node features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised learning framework to model a city’s socioeconomic indicator directly, combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all parameters in a single learning pipeline. In experiments in 12 major U.S. cities, the proposed model achieves considerable explanatory performance and is able to outperform previous conventional machine learning models based on extensive regional-level features. Providing researchers with methods to incorporate network effects in urban modeling, this work also informs stakeholders of wider network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning. © 2025 by the authors.",Graph Neural Networks; socioeconomic modeling; urban mobility,,,,,,,,"Rosvall, Martin, Networks and cities: An information perspective, Physical Review Letters, 94, 2, (2005); Pflieger, Géraldine, Introduction.

Traditional methods for evaluating urban environmental quality have largely overlooked dynamic perceptual changes occurring throughout the day, resulting in incomplete assessments. To bridge this methodological gap, this study presents an innovative approach combining advanced deep learning techniques with time-series street view imagery (SVI) analysis to systematically quantify spatio-temporal variations in the perceived environmental quality of pedestrian-oriented streets. It further addresses two central questions: how perceived environmental quality varies spatially across sections of a pedestrian-oriented street and how these perceptions fluctuate temporally throughout the day. Utilizing Golden Street, a representative living street in Shanghai’s Changning District, as the empirical setting, street view images were manually collected at 96 sampling points across multiple time intervals within a single day. The collected images underwent semantic segmentation using the DeepLabv3+ model, and emotional scores were quantified through the validated MIT Place Pulse 2.0 dataset across six subjective indicators: “Safe,” “Lively,” “Wealthy,” “Beautiful,” “Depressing,” and “Boring.” Spatial and temporal patterns of these indicators were subsequently analyzed to elucidate their relationships with environmental attributes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating deep learning models with time-series SVI for assessing urban environmental perceptions, providing robust empirical insights for urban planners and policymakers. The results emphasize the necessity of context-sensitive, temporally adaptive urban design strategies to enhance urban livability and psychological well-being, ultimately contributing to more vibrant, secure, and sustainable pedestrian-oriented urban environments. © 2025 by the authors.",pedestrian-oriented streets; perceptual analysis; street environmental quality; time-series street view imagery; urban design,environmental quality; image analysis; image resolution; pedestrian; perception; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; time series; urban area; urban design; urbanization; China; Shanghai,,,,,"Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (21YJC760031); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE",This work is supported by the Youth Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education in China under Grant 21YJC760031.,"Schneider, Annemarie, Mapping global urban areas using MODIS 500-m data: New methods and datasets based on 'urban ecoregions, Remote Sensing of Environment, 114, 8, pp. 1733-1746, (2010); Lu, Yi, The effect of street-level greenery on walking behavior: Evidence from Hong Kong, Social Science and Medicine, 208, pp. 41-49, (2018); Saelens, Brian E., Built environment correlates of walking: A review, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 40, 7 SUPPL.1, pp. S550-S566, (2008); Mutual Interaction of People and their Built Environment, (1976); Streets as Public Spaces and Drivers of Urban Prosperity, (2013); Wang, Nan, Morphodynamic modeling of Fourleague Bay in Mississippi River Delta: Sediment fluxes across river-estuary-wetland boundaries, Coastal Engineering, 186, (2023); Liu, Lun, A machine learning-based method for the large-scale evaluation of the qualities of the urban environment, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 65, pp. 113-125, (2017); Biljecki, Filip, Street view imagery in urban analytics and GIS: A review, Landscape and Urban Planning, 215, (2021); Jeon, Junehyung, Deep learning analysis of street panorama images to evaluate the streetscape walkability of neighborhoods for subsidized families in Seoul, Korea, Landscape and Urban Planning, 230, (2023); Huang, Zhonghua, Assessment and determinants of residential satisfaction with public housing in Hangzhou, China, Habitat International, 47, pp. 218-230, (2015)","Y.

However, existing studies have largely focused on the one-sided impact of landscape patterns on either the supply or demand of ESs, with limited investigation into how changes in these patterns affect the growth rates of both supply and demand. The central urban area, characterized by complex urban functions, intricate land use structures, and diverse environmental challenges, further complicates this relationship; yet, the spatiotemporal differentiation patterns of ecosystem services’ supply–demand dynamics in such regions, along with the underlying influencing mechanisms, remain insufficiently explored. To address this gap, the present study uses Shenyang’s central urban area, China as a case study, integrating multiple data sources to quantify the spatiotemporal variations in landscape pattern indices and five ecosystem services: water retention, flood regulation, air purification, carbon sequestration, and habitat quality. The XGBoost model is employed to construct non-linear relationships between landscape pattern indices and the supply–demand ratios of these services. Using SHAP values and LOWESS analysis, this study evaluates both the magnitude and direction of each landscape pattern index’s influence on the ecological supply–demand ratio. The findings outlined above indicate that: there are distinct disparities in the spatiotemporal distribution of landscape pattern indices at the patch type level. Additionally, the changing trends in the supply, demand, and supply–demand ratios of ecosystem services show spatiotemporal differentiation. Overall, the ecosystem services in the study area are developing negatively. Further, the impact of landscape pattern characteristics on ecosystem services is non-linear. Each index has a unique effect, and there are notable threshold intervals. This study provides a novel analytical approach for understanding the intricate relationship between landscape patterns and ESs, offering a scientific foundation and practical guidance for urban ecological protection, restoration initiatives, and territorial spatial planning. © 2025 by the authors.",ecosystem service supply–demand; landscape pattern; territorial spatial planning; threshold regulation; XGBoost-SHAP,demand analysis; ecosystem service; environmental protection; land use change; machine learning; spatial planning; threshold; urban area; urban ecosystem; China; Liaoning; Shenyang,,,,,"Department of Education of Liaoning Province, (JYTQN2023400); Department of Education of Liaoning Province","This research was funded by the Educational Department of Liaoning Province, grant number JYTQN2023400.","Chin Landsc Archit, (2024); Costanza, Robert, The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, Nature, 387, 6630, pp. 253-260, (1997); Chinese Journal of Nature, (2012); Castro, Antonio J., Ecosystem service trade-offs from supply to social demand: A landscape-scale spatial analysis, Landscape and Urban Planning, 132, pp. 102-110, (2014); Baró, Francesc, Mismatches between ecosystem services supply and demand in urban areas: A quantitative assessment in five European cities, Ecological Indicators, 55, pp. 146-158, (2015); Choumert-Nkolo, Johanna, An empirical investigation of public choices for green spaces, Land Use Policy, 27, 4, pp. 1123-1131, (2010); Cheng, Chaonan, Progress and prospect of the spatiotemporal change and ecosystem services evaluation of urban green space pattern, Progress in Geography, 39, 10, pp. 1770-1782, (2020); Landsc Archit, (2021); J Hunan Ecol Sci, (2022); Liu, Yuting, The optimization of territorial spatial resources allocation based on the balance of supply and demand of ecosystem services, Journal of Natural Resources, 39, 6, pp. 1358-1383, (2024)","L.

The pace of change in our societies is accelerated by climate change and the rapid introduction of artificial intelligence and other technologies. When presented with practical challenges or problems to solve that are inherently due to an ageing society, it is not possible for any individual to have the expertise and capacity to address all the dimensions involved. Therefore, developing a multidisciplinary framework that signals the dimensions of influence that need to be considered in adaptive ageing, may assist in optimizing how complex issues in ageing are tackled. This paper proposes a holistic adaptive ageing framework (HAAF) as a starting point for multidisciplinary and multisectoral approaches to develop optimal solutions to complex problems. The five dimensions of the framework include lived experience, person-level adaptation, environmental context, technology and social and economic policy. Future research is needed to operationalize the framework and evaluate its application to complex problems. © The Author(s) 2025.",Adaptive ageing; Framework; Multidisciplinary approaches; Social policy; Technology,"aging; article; artificial intelligence; climate change; cohort analysis; economic aspect; epidemiology; evolutionary adaptation; human; personal experience; aged; Germany; holistic health; psychology; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Artificial Intelligence; Climate Change; Holistic Health; Humans",,,,,(FL190100011),Funding text 1: Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions; Funding text 2: Anstey is funded by ARC Laureate Fellowship FL190100011.,"Aron, Liviu, The adaptive aging brain, Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 72, pp. 91-100, (2022); Atchley, Robert C., A Continuity Theory of Normal Aging, Gerontologist, 29, 2, pp. 183-190, (1989); Balmain, Bryce Nicholas, Aging and Thermoregulatory Control: The Clinical Implications of Exercising under Heat Stress in Older Individuals, BioMed Research International, 2018, (2018); Baltes, Paul B., The many faces of human ageing: Toward a psychological culture of old age, Psychological Medicine, 21, 4, pp. 837-854, (1991); Baltes, Paul B., On the Incomplete Architecture of Human Ontogeny: Selection, Optimization, and Compensation as Foundation of Developmental Theory, American Psychologist, 52, 4, pp. 366-380, (1997); Baltes, Paul B., Lifespan psychology: Theory and application to intellectual functioning, Annual Review of Psychology, 50, pp. 471-507, (1999); Behzadnia, Behzad, Predicting Relations Among Life Goals, Physical Activity, Health, and Well-Being in Elderly Adults: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective on Healthy Aging, pp. 47-71, (2020); Cabeza, Roberto E., Aging gracefully: Compensatory brain activity in high-performing older adults, NeuroImage, 17, 3, pp. 1394-1402, (2002); Carstensen, Laura L., Aging, Emotion, and Evolution: The Bigger Picture, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1000, pp. 152-179, (2003); Carstensen, Laura L., Emotional experience in everyday life across the adult life span, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79, 4, pp. 644-655, (2000)","K.J.

However, the nonlinear associations between zone-specific objective features (e.g., greenery, traffic lights) and subjective perceptions (e.g., beauty and boredom) remain underexplored. This study proposes an analytical framework to investigate such associations in Beijing, China, by integrating street view images (SVIs), panoptic segmentation, and machine learning models. Specifically, we extracted nine objective features and six subjective perceptions from SVIs and modeled their nonlinear associations across different functional zones using 36 XGBoost models combined with SHAP analyses. Model performance was robust, with XGBoost achieving the highest average R2 (0.221) and one of the lowest average RMSE values (0.031) compared to four baseline machine learning models, underscoring its generalizability across perception dimensions and functional zone types. The results reveal three key findings. First, road users and safety barriers consistently ranked among the top contributors to subjective perceptions across all functional zones, while elements like traffic signs exhibited zone-specific effects. Second, the nonlinear associations exhibited varying threshold effects across functional zones, highlighting the context-dependent influence of environmental factors; for example, greenery visibility reduced safety perception in residential zones but enhanced it in commercial zones. Third, typical nonlinear patterns, including V-shaped and threshold effects, were observed, reflecting phenomena such as sensory saturation and diminishing marginal utility. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between urban form and human perception, offering insights for adaptive, human-centric urban design strategies. © 2025 The Authors",Nonlinear associations; Objective features; Subjective perceptions; Urban functional zones,analytical framework; image analysis; machine learning; perception; segmentation; urban area; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFB3903402); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2024A1515012083); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province",This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant No. 2022YFB3903402) and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (grant No. 2024A1515012083).,"Biljecki, Filip, Street view imagery in urban analytics and GIS: A review, Landscape and Urban Planning, 215, (2021); Chen, Shuting, Automatic assessment of public open spaces using street view imagery, Cities, 137, (2023); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016); Cheng, Bowen, Masked-attention Mask Transformer for Universal Image Segmentation, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022-June, pp. 1280-1289, (2022); Cui, Qinyu, Analysing gender differences in the perceived safety from street view imagery, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 124, (2023); Doan, Quang Cuong, Nonlinear and threshold effects of the built environment, road vehicles and air pollution on urban vitality, Landscape and Urban Planning, 253, (2025); Dong, Lin, Assessing impacts of objective features and subjective perceptions of street environment on running amount: A case study of Boston, Landscape and Urban Planning, 235, (2023); Dubey, Abhimanyu, Deep learning the city: Quantifying urban perception at a global scale, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9905 LNCS, pp. 196-212, (2016); undefined, (2021); Feng, Guanqing, The Validity of Street View Service Applied to Ambiance Perception of Street: A Comparison of Assessment in Real Site and Baidu Street View, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 260, pp. 740-748, (2021)","X.

Yet the perceptual implications of three‐dimensional (3D) form remain underexplored. In this study, we combine ResNet50‐based semantic segmentation of street‐view imagery with an XGBoost regression framework interpreted via SHAP values to quantify how 3D landscape morphology shapes residents’ perceptions of vitality, security, and aesthetics. Our model achieves R2 values above 0.85 for all perceptual dimensions, substantially outperforming analogous 2D‐only approaches. We find that urban vibrancy is maximized when total 3D volume (All_3DArea) falls between 1.0 and 3.0 × 10⁶ m3, patch density (PD_All_3D) ranges from 5.0 × 10−5 to 2.0 × 10−4, and vertical relief (RMSofHeight) remains under 10 m. Security perception peaks in human‐scaled contexts (All_3DArea < 5.0 × 105), at very low or very high fragmentation (PD_All_3D < 5.0 × 10−5 or > 2.5 × 10−4), and with moderate summit clustering (Dsummit ≈ 0.005–0.01) and gentle curvature (SummitCur < 1.0). Aesthetic appeal corresponds most strongly to landmark elevations (TenptHeight ≈ 350–400 and near 500), subtle interface complexity (S_dr < 0.05), intermediate fragmentation (PD_All_3D ≈ 1.0–1.2 × 10−4), and summit density (Dsummit ≈ 0.005–0.008). By uncovering these nonlinear “sweet spots,” our findings provide precise, human‐centered guidelines for 3D urban design—informing form‐based regulations, mixed‐use zoning, and topographic modulation to foster cohesive, vibrant, and beautiful cityscapes. © 2025 The Author(s)",3D urban landscape; GIS; Landscape perception; Livable cities; Machine learning,Maps; Regression analysis; Three dimensional computer graphics; Urban growth; Landscape perceptions; Livable city; Machine-learning; Perceptual dimensions; Residents' perceptions; Semantic segmentation; Sustainable cities; Three‐dimensional urban landscape; Urban landscape; Urban population; Mapping; GIS; landscape change; machine learning; perception; regression analysis; resident population; satellite imagery; segmentation; semantic standardization; urban area; urban population; urbanization,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72274025); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",This work has been supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (72274025).,"Ahern, Jack F., Urban landscape sustainability and resilience: The promise and challenges of integrating ecology with urban planning and design, Landscape Ecology, 28, 6, pp. 1203-1212, (2013); Bai, Yujia, 3D compact form as the key role in the cooling effect of greenspace landscape pattern, Ecological Indicators, 160, (2024); Ban, Jin, Evaluation of the factors influencing the housing safety awareness of residents in Shanghai, PLOS ONE, 15, 1, (2020); Biophilic Cities Integrating Nature into Urban Design and Planning, (2011); Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, (1973); Bian, Hongyan, China’s safe and just space during 40 years of rapid urbanization and changing policies, Landscape Ecology, 39, 4, (2024); Bibri, Simon Elias, Compact urbanism and the synergic potential of its integration with data-driven smart urbanism : An extensive interdisciplinary literature review, Land Use Policy, 97, (2020); Cha, Seung Hyun, Spatial perception of ceiling height and type variation in immersive virtual environments, Building and Environment, 163, (2019); Chen, Wenqi, Exploring the paradox of densification and greening in China’ s old cities, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 100, (2024); Chen, Yinan, A study on street walkability for older adults with different mobility abilities combining street view image recognition and deep learning - The case of Chengxianjie Community in Nanjing (China), Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 112, (2024)","J.

The built environment profoundly influences individuals' thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, underscoring the importance of understanding how people perceive their surroundings in relation to objectively measured urban form. Despite growing recognition of the role of perception in shaping urban experience, empirical assessments of the alignment between perceived and actual built environments remain limited. This study explores the relationship between subjective (human-perceived) and objective (measured) characteristics of the built environment through a pilot study conducted in the Melbourne metropolitan area. Using street-level imagery from the Mapillary platform and deep learning techniques, we quantify perceived built environment characteristics across the “5D” urban design dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Distance to transit, and Destination accessibility. These perceptions are then compared to objective spatial metrics to assess their alignment. Our analysis reveals that neighborhoods featuring compact urban form, high density, mixed land use, convenient service access, and abundant green space tend to be perceived as more livable and aesthetically appealing. However, this relationship weakens when density surpasses a threshold, leading to perceptions of overcrowding and reduced neighbourhood quality. The findings offer actionable, place-based evidence for urban planners and policymakers seeking to integrate human perceptions into planning frameworks. Additionally, the study's scalable methodology provides a foundation for developing a national database of perceived built environments in Australia, supporting broader applications in health, social equity, and environmental research. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental psychology; Human perceived built environment; Objective built environment; Street view image; Subjective built environment; Urban planning,Ecodesign; Energy conservation; Environmental management; Green development; Sustainable city; Australia; Built environment; Environmental psychology; Human perceived build environment; Objective build environment; Street view image; Subjective build environment; Urban form; Urban planning; database; machine learning; neighborhood; overcrowding; policy making; psychology; United Nations; urban design; urban planning; adult; aged; article; benchmarking; built environment; city planning; data base; deep learning; emotion; environmental psychology; female; groups by age; human; imagery; land use; metropolitan area; pilot study; social equity; sustainable development goal; city; perception; Built Environment; Cities; City Planning; Humans; Perception; Pilot Projects,,,,,,,"Population, (2023); undefined, (2021); undefined, (2021); Environmental Psychology, (2001); Biljecki, Filip, Street view imagery in urban analytics and GIS: A review, Landscape and Urban Planning, 215, (2021); Bin, Junchi, Multi-source urban data fusion for property value assessment: A case study in Philadelphia, Neurocomputing, 404, pp. 70-83, (2020); Land Use Data, (2023); undefined, (2022); undefined, (2017); undefined, (2017)","S.

While traditional survey data are time-consuming and could result in poor samples, data available via the Internet provides a new way to identify socioeconomic conditions and spatial functions in a city. However, existing methods often face limitations: approaches using only remote imagery or POI (Point of Interest) data fail to capture nuanced socioeconomic features, while social sensing data alone lacks morphological context. To address these challenges, this study presents a data-driven framework integrating POI data and census information, analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (K-Means), to recognize patterns of different socioeconomic levels and functional zones in Lisbon city. Using census data, four distinct types of socioeconomic zones were identified and classified based on specific demographic and economic characteristics. Additionally, the temporal analysis of POI data revealed varying functionalities across zones of different socioeconomic levels, with distinct activity patterns observed at different times of the day and the week. Zones of higher socioeconomic levels exhibited more recreational activity during weekends, while lower socioeconomic areas predominantly supported business-related services. By providing a comprehensive view of the interconnection between socioeconomic levels and functional dynamics, this study offers actionable insights into Lisbon's urban structure. Furthermore, the scalable framework demonstrates significant potential for application in other urban contexts, with implications for urban planning, resource allocation, and social equity. © 2025 The Authors",Functional zoning; K-means clustering; Land use; Socioeconomic characterization; Spatial data analysis; Urban planning,algorithm; cluster analysis; data management; land use; socioeconomic status; spatial data; urban planning; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal,,,,,"European Social Fund Plus, ESF; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/00326/2025, UIDP/00326/2025, PRT/BD/154266/2022); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the doctoral Grant PRT/BD/154266/2022 financed by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), and with funds from the State Budget, European Social Fund (ESF), through the Regional Operational Program of the Center (Centro 2020), and under the MIT Portugal Program.; Funding text 2: This work is financed through national funds by FCT - Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnologia, I.P. , in the framework of the Project UIDB/00326/2025 and UIDP/00326/2025.; Funding text 3: This work is financed through national funds by FCT - Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnologia, I.P., in the framework of the Project UIDB/00326/2025 and UIDP/00326/2025., This research was supported by the doctoral Grant PRT/BD/154266/2022 financed by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), and with funds from the State Budget, European Social Fund (ESF), through the Regional Operational Program of the Center (Centro 2020), and under the MIT Portugal Program.","Alho, André Romano, Analyzing the relation between land-use/urban freight operations and the need for dedicated infrastructure/enforcement - Application to the city of Lisbon, Research in Transportation Business and Management, 11, pp. 85-97, (2014); undefined; American Psychology Association; Computer Science Mathematics, (2004); Measuring Socioeconomic Status Ses in the Ncvs Background Options and Recommendations, (2014); Cao, Su, Functional Classification of Urban Parks Based on Urban Functional Zone and Crowd-Sourced Geographical Data, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 10, 12, (2021); undefined, (2024); Cocola-Gant, Agustín, Holiday rentals: The new gentrification battlefront, Sociological Research Online, 21, 3, (2016); Darin-Mattsson, Alexander, Different indicators of socioeconomic status and their relative importance as determinants of health in old age, International Journal for Equity in Health, 16, 1, (2017); undefined, (2020)","C.

This study utilizes high-resolution PlanetScope imagery and a U-Net deep learning model to assess the flood impact and analyze post-rainfall recovery patterns in Dubai’s urban landscape. By integrating Sentinel-2derived land use and land cover (LULC) data to refine the training dataset, a high-accuracy U-Net model was developed through transfer learning that effectively classified pre- and post-rainfall LULC. Post-rainfall LULC change detections indicate that 23.8 km2 of land was flooded, which is equivalent to about 10 times the area of Downtown Dubai. Bare ground (66% of the flooded land) and built area (32% of the flooded land) were the most affected, while vegetation (2% of the flooded land) presented greater flood resilience. Post-event monitoring revealed that 95% of flooded areas remained submerged after three days and 37% were still underwater even ten days post-event. These findings highlight the prolonged impact of extreme rainfall on urban infrastructure in an arid environment. This study contributes to remote sensing-based flood impact assessment by leveraging high-resolution PlanetScope imagery and deep learning techniques. It demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in improving LULC classification, particularly for minority classes such as small-patch vegetation. The results provide critical insights into urban flood recovery dynamics and offer valuable information for disaster management, flood resilience planning, and future urban adaptation strategies. © Author(s) 2025.",extreme rainfall; LULC classification; PlanetScope; U-Net; urban resilience assessment,Classification (of information); Deep learning; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Flood control; Floods; Land use; Learning systems; Oil well flooding; Rain; Recovery; Remote sensing; Transfer learning; Urban planning; Extreme rainfall; High resolution; Land use and land cover; Land-use and land-cover classifications; Planetscope; U-net; Urban landscape; Urban resilience; Urban resilience assessment; Vegetation,,,,,,,"Guardian, (2024); Khaleej Times, (2024); Basheer, Sana, A comparative analysis of PlanetScope 4-band and 8-band imageries for land use land cover classification, Geomatica, 76, 2, (2024); Chanda, Mithu, Application of PlanetScope Imagery for Flood Mapping: A Case Study in South Chickamauga Creek, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Remote Sensing, 16, 23, (2024); Financial Times, (2024); United Arab Emirates Region Boundaries, (2024); Dubai Floods April 2024 Jba Risk Management, (2024); Lombana, Lorena, A Flood Mapping Method for Land Use Management in Small-Size Water Bodies: Validation of Spectral Indexes and a Machine Learning Technique, Agronomy, 12, 6, (2022); Royal Meteorological Society, (2024); Flash Floods Will Increase in Frequency in the Gulf, (2024)","X.

This study provides an updated analysis of UHI trends in Abu Dhabi using Land Surface Temperature (LST) data retrieved from moderate-resolution Landsat imagery spanning from April 2013 to December 2024. Monthly and seasonal LST trends are assessed across four land-use categories: consistent urban, land to urban (developed), inundation, and reclamation. Results reveal that while urban areas exhibit a cooling trend in peak summer (-2.46°C/year), they show a significant warming trend in winter (+2.64°C/year), reinforcing UHI effects. Inundation zones demonstrate the oasis effect, mitigating peak summer heat (-2.37°C/year). At the same time, reclamation areas show sustained warming in both seasons (+2.93°C/year in summer, +4.20°C/year in winter), indicating the loss of natural heat-buffering mechanisms. A key novelty of this study is the integration of land cover and land-use change analysis with multiseasonal LST trends, revealing the aggressive construction-driven transformation of the urban landscape. Unlike previous studies (e.g., Lazzarini et al., 2015), which primarily documented UHI presence, our research highlights how changes in land-use composition, particularly the loss of water bodies and green spaces due to reclamation, exacerbate warming trends despite urban cooling interventions. The findings challenge earlier assumptions of a uniform UHI increase, showing that land-use planning plays a decisive role in seasonal heat retention and dissipation. However, ongoing land reclamation appears to counteract these gains, necessitating further research on climate adaptation strategies. © Author(s) 2025.",Arid Region; Coastal Reclamation; Land Surface Temperature; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Urban Expansion,Arid regions; Atmospheric temperature; Expansion; Land reclamation; Land surface temperature; Land use; Landforms; Learning systems; Reclamation; Space optics; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Urban planning; Abu Dhabi; Coastal reclamation; Machine-learning; Remote-sensing; Temperature trends; Urban expansion; Urban heat island; Urban Heat Island Effects; Waterbodies; Remote sensing,,,,,"New York University Abu Dhabi, NYUAD","This research was supported by the 19WSN Faculty Fellowship (Grant No. 75-71003-ADHPG-SQN01), from New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD).","Lazzarini, Michele, Urban climate modifications in hot desert cities: The role of land cover, local climate, and seasonality, Geophysical Research Letters, 42, 22, pp. 9980-9989, (2015); Santamouris, Matthaios J., Analyzing the heat island magnitude and characteristics in one hundred Asian and Australian cities and regions, Science of the Total Environment, 512-513, pp. 582-598, (2015); Environmental Earth Sciences, (2021); Rasul, Azad, Applying built-up and bare-soil indices from Landsat 8 to cities in dry climates, Land, 7, 3, (2018); Sultan, Mubbashra, Fifty years of land use and land cover mapping in the United Arab Emirates: a machine learning approach using Landsat satellite data, Frontiers in Earth Science, 12, (2024); Dahy, Basam S., RANDOM FOREST FOR CLASSIFYING AND MONITORING 50 YEARS OF VEGETATION DYNAMICS IN THREE DESERT CITIES OF THE UAE, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 43, B3-2022, pp. 69-76, (2022); Lazzarini, Michele, Temperature-land cover interactions: The inversion of urban heat island phenomenon in desert city areas, Remote Sensing of Environment, 130, pp. 136-152, (2013)",,"Al Mansoori, S.; Kaur, N.; Haneef, M.",International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,,"2025 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Geospatial Week, GSW 2025",2025-04-06 through 2025-04-11,Dubai,210980,16821750,9781629935126; 9781629934297; 9781629935201,,,English,"Int.

Data collected from a field survey involving 24 public open spaces in Hong Kong, including perceptual responses from 1,882 participants and physical measurements, formed the basis of the analysis. The prediction model was constructed using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, as it outperformed the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and significantly exceeded the performance of traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) models in handling datasets with high contextual complexity. To circumvent the shortcomings of non-transparency and non-interpretable in machine-learning models, this study incorporated SHAP analysis to identify the most influential factors for open space soundscape and to investigate their interactions, which has not been revealed in earlier soundscape research. LAeq, perceived dominance of road traffic noise, greenery percentage and PET, were identified as the most influential factors. LAeq and perceived dominance of road traffic noise had significant negative effects, especially when LAeq exceeded 68 dBA. Greenery percentage showed a threshold effect, with dominant and positive contributions only when coverage exceeded 40 %. Notably, PET and its interaction with LAeq had a significant impact, with high temperatures (> 35 °C) intensifying the negative impacts of high sound pressure levels. These findings underscore the importance of “sound-visual-thermal” interactions and highlight that urban design should minimize the coexistence of high sound pressure levels, elevated temperatures, and heightened road traffic noise perceptions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Machine learning; Multisensory; Nonlinearity; SHAP analysis; Soundscape,Acoustic field measurement; Acoustic noise measurement; Linear regression; Traffic surveys; Influential factors; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Multisensory; Nonlinearity; Public open spaces; Road traffic noise; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation analyze; Soundscapes; Acoustic intensity measurement; game theory; machine learning; noise; nonlinearity; open space; perception; public space; road traffic; urban design; China; Hong Kong,,,,,,,"Salih, Sarah Abdulkareem, Criteria for Public Open Space Enhancement to Achieve Social Interaction: A Review Paper, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 291, 1, (2018); Lestan, Katarina Ana, The role of open space in urban neighbourhoods for health-related lifestyle, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 11, 6, pp. 6547-6570, (2014); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2016); undefined; Sudarsono, Anugrah Sabdono, The effect of sound level on perception of reproduced soundscapes, Applied Acoustics, 110, pp. 53-60, (2016); Genuit, Klaus, Psychoacoustics and its benefit for the soundscape approach, Acta Acustica United with Acustica, 92, 6, pp. 952-958, (2006); Liu, Jiang, Landscape effects on soundscape experience in city parks, Science of the Total Environment, 454-455, pp. 474-481, (2013); Pijanowski, Bryan Christopher, Soundscape ecology: The science of sound in the landscape, BioScience, 61, 3, pp. 203-216, (2011); Lionello, Matteo, A systematic review of prediction models for the experience of urban soundscapes, Applied Acoustics, 170, (2020); Annual Review of Psychology, (1973)","H.C.

In the Mendrisio district (Switzerland), we deployed a low-cost, AI-powered sensor to monitor pedestrian and vehicle flows in different seasons. The sensor uses camera-based image recognition to detect and classify objects in real time while preserving privacy by avoiding biometric or identity-related data capture, in full compliance with GDPR. The system was developed using open source hardware and software. Processes video frames on edge using a lightweight machine learning model optimized for embedded devices and periodically transmits summary data (object type, direction, timestamp) via NB-IoT to a centralized data platform. The collected data was used to generate temporal analyses and heatmaps of space usage and to validate the classification accuracy in different weather and lighting conditions. Field tests demonstrated the sensor’s capability to operate autonomously for extended periods with low power consumption, while highlighting limitations in NB-IoT connectivity in specific locations. Despite these constraints, the system provided valuable information on public space utilization, identifying peak hours and spatial patterns relevant for mobility planning and urban design. This approach offers a replicable and cost-effective solution for municipalities seeking data-driven support for decision-making. By combining privacy-sensitive AI, open technologies, and standard data models (such as SensorThings API), the project contributes to a more transparent and inclusive digital urban ecosystem.

By converting pixels into Cubixels, we can analyze the image’s 3D properties, thereby enriching image processing and computer vision tasks. Utilizing Cubixels, we’ve developed algorithms for advanced image segmentation, edge detection, texture analysis, and feature extraction, yielding a deeper comprehension of image content. Our empirical experimental results on benchmark images and datasets showcase the applicability of these concepts. Further, we discuss future applications of Cubixels and VoV in various domains, particularly in medical imaging, where they have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic processes. By interpreting images as complex ‘urban landscapes’, we envision a new frontier for deep learning models that simulate and learn from diverse environmental conditions. The integration of Cubixels into deep learning architectures promises to revolutionize the field, providing a pathway towards more intelligent, context-aware artificial intelligence systems. With this groundbreaking work, we aim to inspire future research that will unlock the full potential of image data, transforming both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

These features are fused with multi-source geospatial data encompassing 23 built environment variables into an interpretable machine learning pipeline using SHAP-optimized random forest models. The key findings reveal distinct nonlinear response patterns between HP and MA modes to built environment factors; for instance, a notable promotion in mechanically assisted NMT vitality is observed as enterprise density increases beyond 0.2 facilities per ha. Emergent synergistic and threshold effects are evident from variable interactions requiring multidimensional planning consideration, as demonstrated in phenomena such as the peaking of human-powered NMT vitality occurring at public facility densities of 0.2–0.8 facilities per ha, enterprise densities of 0.6–1 facilities per ha, and spatial heterogeneity patterns identified through Bivariate Local Moran’s I clustering. This research contributes an innovative technical framework combining street view image recognition with explainable AI, while practically informing urban planning through evidence-based mobility zone classification and targeted strategy formulation, enabling more precise optimization of pedestrian-/cyclist-oriented urban spaces. © 2025 by the authors.",explainable machine learning (XAI); non-motorized transportation (NMT); object detection; Shapley additive explanation (SHAP); street view imagery (SVI),cluster analysis; detection method; imagery; machine learning; mobility; optimization; spatial analysis; urban design; urban planning; urban transport,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LHZY24A010001); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province, (2024C03234); Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (E43302020D, E2Z105010F); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","This research was supported by the Joint Funds of the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. LHZY24A010001; and the Key R&D Program of Zhejiang (No.2024C03234); and the Talent introduction Program Youth Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (E43302020D, E2Z105010F).","Balsas, Carlos J.L., Blending Individual Tenacity with Government’s Responsibility in the Implementation of US Non-motorized Transportation Planning (NMT), Planning Practice and Research, 32, 2, pp. 197-211, (2017); Mansoor, Umer, A review of factors and benefits of non-motorized transport: a way forward for developing countries, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 24, 2, pp. 1560-1582, (2022); Naess, Petter, Built Environment, Causality and Travel, Transport Reviews, 35, 3, pp. 275-291, (2015); Transportation in Developing Economies, (2022); Miranda-Moreno, Luis F., The link between built environment, pedestrian activity and pedestrian-vehicle collision occurrence at signalized intersections, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 43, 5, pp. 1624-1634, (2011); Mirzakhani, Arman, Pedestrian movement patterns in historical urban fabrics, GeoJournal, 88, 6, pp. 6483-6506, (2023); Cao, Jason (Jason), The relationship between the built environment and nonwork travel: A case study of Northern California, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 43, 5, pp. 548-559, (2009); Liu, Chao, An empirical analysis of the influence of urban form on household travel and energy consumption, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 35, 5, pp. 347-357, (2011); Ewing, Reid H., Travel and the built environment, Journal of the American Planning Association, 76, 3, pp. 265-294, (2010); Lanzini, Pietro, From techno-centrism to socio-centrism: The evolution of principles for urban sustainable mobility, International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, 15, 11, pp. 815-825, (2021)","X.

Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods offer high accuracy in simulating wind fields but are computationally intensive and inefficient for large-scale, multi-scenario urban planning tasks. To address this limitation, this study proposes a morphology-driven, machine learning-based framework for ventilation corridor identification. The method integrates Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulations, neighborhood-based feature normalization, and a random forest regression model to establish a predictive relationship between morphological indices and wind speed distributions under prevailing wind conditions. Input features include raw and log-transformed LBM values, neighborhood-normalized indicators within multiple radii (100–2000 m), and porosity statistics. The model is trained and validated using CFD-simulated wind speeds, with the dataset randomly divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) subsets. The results show that the proposed method can accurately predict spatial wind speed patterns and identify both primary and secondary ventilation corridors. Primary corridors are closely aligned with large rivers and lakes, while secondary corridors are shaped by arterial roads and localized open spaces. Compared with conventional approaches such as FAI classification, Least Cost Path (LCP), and circuit theory models, the proposed framework offers higher spatial resolution and better alignment with the CFD results while significantly reducing computational cost. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using morphological and data-driven approaches to support efficient and scalable urban ventilation analysis, providing valuable guidance for climate-responsive urban design. © 2025 by the authors.",Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM); morphological indices; random forest; urban ventilation corridors,,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (42201466, 42475038); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF; China Meteorological Administration, CMA, (LUM-2024-18); China Meteorological Administration, CMA; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2021QD078); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; (SYSZD202502)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Program, grant number 42201466, the Shandong Province Natural Science Foundation Youth Branch, grant number ZR2021QD078, the National Science Foundation of China (42475038), Key Laboratory of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration (LUM-2024-18), and Hangzhou Urban Meteorological Joint Laboratory (SYSZD202502).","Ng, Yan Yung Edward, Policies and technical guidelines for urban planning of high-density cities - air ventilation assessment (AVA) of Hong Kong, Building and Environment, 44, 7, pp. 1478-1488, (2009); Yim, Steve H.L., An assessment indicator for air ventilation and pollutant dispersion potential in an urban canopy with complex natural terrain and significant wind variations, Atmospheric Environment, 94, pp. 297-306, (2014); Liu, Yonghong, A preliminary study on the influence of Beijing urban spatial morphology on near-surface wind speed, Urban Climate, 34, (2020); Li, Qingmei, RAV model: Study on urban refined climate environment assessment and ventilation corridors construction, Building and Environment, 248, (2024); Ying, Shen, City-scale ventilation analysis using 3D buildings with Guangzhou case, Urban Climate, 49, (2023); He, Baojie, Relationships among local-scale urban morphology, urban ventilation, urban heat island and outdoor thermal comfort under sea breeze influence, Sustainable Cities and Society, 60, (2020); Gu, Kangkang, Spatial planning for urban ventilation corridors by urban climatology, Ecosystem Health and Sustainability, 6, 1, (2020); Xue, Jiao, Applications of local climate zone classification scheme to improve urban sustainability: A bibliometric review, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 19, pp. 1-14, (2020); Palusci, Olga, Urban Ventilation in the Compact City: A Critical Review and a Multidisciplinary Methodology for Improving Sustainability and Resilience in Urban Areas, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 7, (2022); Liu, Xiaoqian, Wind environment assessment and planning of urban natural ventilation corridors using GIS: Shenzhen as a case study, Urban Climate, 42, (2022)","P.

While perceptions are shaped by the interplay of multiple visual elements, existing studies often isolate single semantic features, overlooking their combinations. This study proposes a Landscape Element Combination Extraction Method (SLECEM), which integrates the UniSal saliency detection model and semantic segmentation to identify landscape combinations that play a dominant role in human perceptions of streetscapes. Using street view images (SVIs) from the central area of Futian District, Shenzhen, China, we further construct a multi-dimensional feature–perception coupling analysis framework. The key findings are as follows: 1. Both low-level visual features (e.g., color, contrast, fractal dimension) and high-level semantic features (e.g., tree, sky, and building proportions) significantly influence streetscape perceptions, with strong nonlinear effects from the latter. 2. K-Means clustering of salient landscape element combinations reveals six distinct streetscape types and perception patterns. 3. Combinations of landscape features better reflect holistic human perception than single variables. 4. Tailored urban design strategies are proposed for different streetscape perception goals (e.g., beauty, safety, and liveliness). Overall, this study deepens the understanding of streetscape perception mechanisms and proposes a highly operational quantitative framework, offering systematic theoretical guidance and methodological tools to enhance the responsiveness and sustainability of urban streetscapes. © 2025 by the authors.",landscape element combination; SHAP interpretability analysis; street view image (SVI); streetscape perceptions; urban design strategies; XGBoost,landscape; machine learning; optimization; perception; sustainability; urban design; China; Futian; Guangdong; Shenzhen,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (52108059); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52108059).,"Xu, Jiayuan, Effects of urban living environments on mental health in adults, Nature Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 1456-1467, (2023); Place Branding and Public Diplomacy, (2008); Appleyard, Donald, The Environmental Quality of City Streets: The Residents’ Viewpoint, Journal of the American Planning Association, 38, 2, pp. 84-101, (1972); Cheng, Liang, Use of Tencent Street View imagery for visual perception of streets, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 6, 9, (2017); Callaghan, A., The impact of green spaces on mental health in urban settings: a scoping review, Journal of Mental Health, 30, 2, pp. 179-193, (2021); Batistatou, Adamantia, Virtual Reality to Evaluate the Impact of Colorful Interventions and Nature Elements on Spontaneous Walking, Gaze, and Emotion, Frontiers in Virtual Reality, 3, (2022); Zhang, Yonglin, The premium of public perceived greenery: A framework using multiscale gwr and deep learning, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 13, (2021); Zhang, Zhehao, Campus environmental quality and streetscape features related to walking activity, Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering, 23, 1, pp. 405-423, (2024); Dong, Lin, Assessing impacts of objective features and subjective perceptions of street environment on running amount: A case study of Boston, Landscape and Urban Planning, 235, (2023); He, Nan, Urban neighbourhood environment assessment based on street view image processing: A review of research trends, Environmental Challenges, 4, (2021)","J.

Considering the limitations of current garden design, which is inefficient and relies on human experience, this study proposes an intelligent generation framework based on a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). In constructing the CGAN model, we determine the spatial characteristics of the Suzhou Gardens and, combined with historical floor plan data, train the network. We then design an optimization strategy for the model training process and finally test and verify the generative space scheme. The research results indicate the following: (1) The CGAN model can effectively capture the key elements of the garden space and generate a planar scheme that conforms to the traditional space with an accuracy rate reaching 91.08%. (2) This model can be applied to projects ranging from 200 to 1000 square meters. The generated results can provide multiple scheme comparisons for update decisions, helping managers to efficiently select the optimal solution. (3) Decision-makers can conduct space utilization analyses and evaluations based on the generated results. In conclusion, this study can help decision-makers to efficiently generate and evaluate the feasibility of different design schemes, providing intelligent support for decision-making in urban renewal plans. © 2025 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; design decision-making; Jiangnan gardens; urban landscape renewal,Generative adversarial networks; Learning systems; Optimization; Personnel training; Urban planning; Adversarial networks; Case-studies; Decision makers; Design decision-making; Jiangnan garden; Machine-learning; Network models; Urban landscape; Urban landscape renewal; World cultural heritages; Decision making,,,,,"Macau University of Science and Technology, MUST, (FRG-25-041-FA); Macau University of Science and Technology, MUST","This research was supported by the Faculty Research Grants funded by Macau University of Science and Technology (grant number: FRG-25-041-FA).

Furthermore, this paper discusses future perspectives on biomimetics-driven innovations, emphasising their potential to foster resilience, efficiency, and sustainability in rapidly evolving technological landscapes. Particular attention is given to neuromorphic hardware, a biologically inspired computing paradigm that mimics neural processing through spike-based communication and analogue architectures. Key components such as memristors and neuromorphic processors enable adaptive, low-power, task-specific computation, with wide-ranging applications in robotics, AI, healthcare, and renewable energy systems.

However, traditional assessment methods, such as the green view index, primarily quantify green coverage while neglecting vegetation diversity, color richness, and seasonal dynamics, which are critical for urban livability. Objectives: This study develops a multi-temporal and multi-perspective analysis framework for urban green space visualization, introducing the Seasonal Species-Specific Plant View Index (S3PVI) to quantify plant coverage at the species level, capturing seasonal changes and visual diversity. Methods: The framework integrates computer vision, deep learning, and 3D reconstruction technologies, including structure from motion and 3D Gaussian splatting. To validate the S3PVI, case studies were conducted in Suita City, Japan, analyzing real-world seasonal vegetation patterns and testing the framework in a virtual park environment to assess its applicability in urban design. Results: The S3PVI effectively captured species-specific seasonal patterns, with cherry blossoms peaking at 45.61% visibility in spring and maples at 56.78% in autumn. Comparative analysis revealed distinctive vegetation strategies between streets, with Sanshikisaido showing higher seasonal amplitude but lower consistency than Nakayoshido. Virtual simulations confirmed that multi-species schemes optimally balanced seasonal impact with year-round visual stability. Conclusions: The S3PVI framework advances urban vegetation assessment by providing species-specific and seasonally dynamic visual data, supporting evidence-based urban planning for ecological sustainability and livability.

While many studies have characterized constructed wetlands’ (CWs) performance for removing conventional pollutants (TN, TP and TSS), the relationships between these parameters and metal concentrations remain unexplored—despite metals’ ecological risks and regulatory significance. Thus, this study investigates the relationships between the commonly measured pollutants (TN, TP and TSS) and metal concentrations in CWs, proposing a method to estimate metal levels using existing monitoring data. Therefore, it provides a practical, cost-effective solution to infer metal pollution without additional sampling burdens, thereby advancing urban stormwater management practices and advocating for the inclusion of heavy metals in regulatory frameworks. Monitoring from a CW in an industrialized suburb in Melbourne, Australia between 2017 and 2022 was conducted. The canonical correlation analysis confirms the significant interactions between TN, TP, TSS and metals. Multivariate modelling further highlights the potential of predicting Zn using pollutants in the current best practice management guideline and physio-chemical parameters (R2 = 0.86). It is envisioned that results will offer relevant stakeholders a cost-effective approach to determine metal levels in CWs using TN, TP and TSS as proxy indicators in the face of evolving and uncertain climate conditions. Findings of this study will have implications for reducing the financial burden of ongoing monitoring and improving the design and management of future endeavours by optimizing the more influential parameters. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Best management practice; Constructed wetland; Correlation analysis; Heavy metals; Urban stormwater management; Water quality,"Climate change; Correlation methods; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Information management; Metal analysis; Pollution detection; Quality control; Storm sewers; Water pollution; Best Management Practise; Constructed wetland; Correlation analysis; Metal concentrations; Metal levels; Statistical techniques; Stormwater pollutants; Urban cities; Urban landscape; Urban stormwater management; Storms; heavy metal; storm water; zinc; best management practice; concentration (composition); constructed wetland; correlation; environmental management; future prospect; industrial district; stakeholder; stormwater; urban area; urban planning; water management; water pollution; water quality; Article; climate change; correlation analysis; geostatistical analysis; landscape; machine learning; nonhuman; nutrient; pollutant; pollution; precipitation; principal component analysis; shrub; suspended particulate matter; temperature; vegetation; wetland; Australia; city; environmental monitoring; procedures; sewage; water pollutant; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Wetlands",,"zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Metals, Heavy; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"The research presented in this paper was conducted at Swinburne University of Technology, whose support and resources were instrumental to its completion.

The aim, was to systematically map and assess the degree of use of digital technologies in, landscape planning as well as propose guidance for further research, We performed a scoping review of 53,114 papers published from January 2012 until, May 2023. We followed the PRISMA-ScR framework, combined with semi-automated, data charting and bibliometric analysis. This approach allowed us to identify and, classify relevant literature, technology trends, and correlations between different DT.The algorithms we developed can be used to monitor DT in LP. By comprehensive, analysis, we identified trends and their dynamics over the last decade, the direction of technological evolution, and correlations between the technologies. We identified 35 technologies, which we grouped into 12 categories: Remote Sensing (RS); Geographical Information Systems (GIS); Other Digital Modelling (mathematical and statistical); Artificial Intelligence Related (AI-Related); Information and Communication Technologies (ICT); 3D Modelling; Data; Decision Support Systems (DSS); Robotic; Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality/Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR); Social Media; and Computer Aided Design (CAD). Our analysis revealed that only a few are currently integral to the planning process (RS, GIS, Other Digital Modelling, AI-Related, and 3D Modelling), whereas others, such as AI and data technologies, now rapidly evolving, have started to expand their application. Machine Learning (ML) and RS are the most dynamically growing technologies while emerging technologies include Other ICT, BIM, VR/AR/MR, and Social Media. The most prominent reciprocal correlation is between Data – RS – AIRelated. This study's significance lies in its comprehensive mapping of digital technologies in landscape planning, which provides valuable insights for planners, policymakers, and researchers. Major conclusions reveal that more knowledge of technologies explicitly targeting the LP is needed, including understanding and associating their feasibility and application for different process phases and smooth overall workflow.

Over the years, urban landscapes have adapted to accommodate the increasing numbers of cars dominating the streets. However, recent trends in major European cities show a shift toward reclaiming urban spaces for pedestrians. This study delves into urban characteristics that either enhance or hinder pedestrian walkability, leveraging open data sources for analysis. Using an Uber-designed hexagon-based grid system, this research quantifies the maximum walkable area associated with each census tract in the urban area of Madrid, Spain. Employing a multi-equational spatial econometric model, the study identifies urban barriers that influence the extent of walkable spaces. Results indicate that urban features catering to vehicular traffic, such as highways, roundabouts, and wide streets, tend to reduce the maximum walkable area for pedestrians. Conversely, wider sidewalks, a higher density of pedestrian crosswalks, and increased building density contribute to expanding the maximum walkable area. Furthermore, a machine learning algorithm known as multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) has uncovered the non-linear effects of these variables on walkability. Identifying these factors can assist policymakers in formulating strategies related to urban planning and the development of pedestrian-friendly cities, underscoring the significance of analyzing barriers and amenities that shape walkability. © 2025",Machine learning techniques; Spatial modeling; Walkability; x-minute city,algorithm; car use; machine learning; pedestrian; urban design; urban planning; urban population; urban transport; walking; Community of Madrid; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Spain,,,,,"McMaster University; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MCIN, (PID2022-136252NB-I00, MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MCIN","The authors would like to thank Professor Antonio P\u00E1ez (McMaster University) for his support with the R code used to evaluate the maximum walkable area during the pleasant meeting in the beautiful setting of Mar de Cristal.

This study bridges the gap by integrating deep learning and cluster analysis. We constructed a dataset through manual aesthetic ratings of 500 sampled street images by 150 participants, then fine-tuned a ResNet-50 to automatically predict the aesthetic of 16,455 streetscape images from Wuhan. Street design quality was assessed using visual landscape elements derived from semantic segmentation, while the HDBSCAN algorithm was employed to cluster streetscape types. Multiple linear regression and grouped regression analysis were employed to examine design-aesthetic relationships across six streetscape types. Key findings include: (1) the model's high accuracy in assessing aesthetics, with vegetation and water as key factors; (2) streetscapes were categorized into six clusters, with highways and bridges rated as having the highest aesthetic quality, and overpasses rated the lowest; (3) greenness, openness, and walkability strongly correlated with aesthetics, especially in residential streets; and (4) The impact of street design quality on aesthetic perception varies significantly across different types of streets, suggesting that street function may influence aesthetic standards.

To address this as a long-term issue, accurately predicting building energy use at the urban level is indispensable. Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) is an emerging method to investigate urban design and energy systems at urban and neighborhood levels. UBEM methods are considered reasonably accurate in simulating the performance of almost any building combinations. However, customized urban projects, and optimization problems involving many UBEM scenarios, are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and based on the scalability, the simulation runtime can be exponentially high if a broad set of design variations is analyzed. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to generate a surrogate model for UBEM and accelerate the simulation process. Based on the extensively used forecasting model, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), we extract the static covariate encoder and variable selection network from the TFT structure while adding a small neural network to model the probability of triggering heating and cooling needs. The major advantages compared to other surrogate models are: (i) A sequential input in the transformer-based model to improve the temporal accuracy. (ii) A physics-inspired training strategy that builds on weather dynamics and urban interactions for hourly energy demands concurrently with a customized loss function. (iii) Improved generalizability for the proposed surrogate model using open and public data. In our study of 114 buildings in different climate zones in the US, our model predicts heating and cooling triggers in unseen climate dynamics with an F1 score of 0.83 while the root mean squared error (RMSE) of hourly loads was 71.51 kWh. This model is available for interfacing with climate projections and city-scale analysis as part of atmospheric urban digital twins. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",0000; 1111; Machine learning; Temporal fusion transformer; Urban building energy modeling,0000; Building energy model; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heating and cooling; Machine-learning; Surrogate modeling; Temperature variables; Temporal fusion transformer; Urban building energy modeling; Urban buildings; accuracy assessment; greenhouse gas; machine learning; numerical model; performance assessment; project assessment; scenario analysis; simulation; urban area; urban climate; urban design; United States,,,,,,,"World Population Prospects 2017; World Population Prospects 2022 Summary of Results, (2022); Patel, Pratiman, Deep learning-based urban morphology for city-scale environmental modeling, PNAS Nexus, 2, 3, (2023); Globus Global Building Heights for Urban Studies, (2022); Hsu, Shun Hsiang, A Framework for Utilization of Occupants’ Trajectory Data to Enhance Building Management, Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering, 98, pp. 740-754, (2021); Lin, Calvin, UTwin: A digital twin of the UT Austin campus, pp. 282-283, (2023); Swan, Lukas G., Modeling of end-use energy consumption in the residential sector: A review of modeling techniques, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 13, 8, pp. 1819-1835, (2009); Proceedings of International Conference Cisbat 2015 Future Buildings and Districts Sustainability from Nano to Urban Scale, (2015); Robinson, Darren, Citysim: Comprehensive micro-simulation of resource flows for sustainable urban planning, pp. 1083-1090, (2009); Hensen, J.

This study used jogging trajectories and street view data in the main urban areas of Hangzhou in 2021 and analyzed 2D and 3D built environments using kernel density estimation and CRITIC weighting modeling. By adopting methods including random forest and geographic weighted regression modeling, it explored the relationship of 2D and 3D built environment factors on outdoor jogging activities. The results indicate that: (1) Accessibility and coverage of blue-green spaces are the main factors affecting outdoor jogging activities in the 2D built environment (2DBE), while green view ratio, terrain coverage, pedestrian flow, boundary separation, and facade continuity are key factors in the 3D built environment (3DBE). (2) High-quality environmental areas have a higher frequency of jogging than low-quality environmental areas. (3) Compared to 3DBE, 2DBE shows a higher correlation with jogging. (4) There is environmental inequality in the study area, with a Gini coefficient of 0.521 overall. The empirical results are conducive to formulating and implementing sustainable and healthy urban design strategies from two-dimensional and three-dimensional environmental perspectives. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2D/3D built environment; Comprehensive evaluation system; Machine learning; Outdoor jogging activities; Random forest,Environmental design; 'current; 2d/3d build environment; Built environment; Comprehensive evaluation system; Environment influence; Environmental areas; High-density cities; Machine-learning; Outdoor jogging activity; Random forests; Ecodesign; environmental assessment; environmental factor; GIS; machine learning; physical activity; regression analysis; resource allocation; three-dimensional modeling; two-dimensional modeling; urban area; urban design; China; Hangzhou; Zhejiang,,,,,"(XSP25YBC476); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University, (1053320232369); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University",This article was funded by the 2025 Hunan Province Social Science Achievement Review Committee Project Achievements (XSP25YBC476); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (1053320232369).,"Abe, Takumi, The relationship of car driving and bicycle riding on physical activity and social participation in Japanese rural areas, Journal of Transport and Health, 10, pp. 315-321, (2018); Adkins, Arlie, Unpacking Walkability: Testing the Influence of Urban Design Features on Perceptions of Walking Environment Attractiveness, Journal of Urban Design, 17, 4, pp. 499-510, (2012); Ao, Yibin, Influences of rural built environment on travel mode choice of rural residents: The case of rural Sichuan, Journal of Transport Geography, 85, (2020); Ara, Ignacio, Physical activity assessment in the general population; validated self-report methods, Nutricion Hospitalaria, 31, pp. 211-218, (2015); Package Rfpermute, (2016); Arribas-Bel, Daniel, Understanding (urban) spaces through form and function, Habitat International, 128, (2022); Bai, Zhuhui, The relationships between 2D and 3D green index altered by spatial attributes at high spatial resolution, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 101, (2024); Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2016 Taking on Inequality, (2016); Boots, Barry N., Global and local spatial autocorrelation in bounded regular tessellations, Journal of Geographical Systems, 2, 4, pp. 319-348, (2000); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001)","C.

BRCs have also been proposed as a best management practice (BMP) to control the export of contaminants from urban landscapes, including the macronutrients phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). To determine whether bioretention systems are effective in mitigating P and N enrichment of urban stormwater runoff, we extracted hydrologic and nutrient concentration data for over 400 precipitation events across more than 30 BRCs from the International Stormwater BMP Database. The concentration data included total P (TP), soluble reactive P (SRP), total N (TN), and dissolved inorganic N (DIN). Among the BRCs included in our analysis, 74 and 89 % exhibited average concentrations of TP and SRP that were higher in the surface outflow than in the inflow, respectively. However, the corresponding outflow loads of TP and SRP were generally lower, mainly because of reductions in surface runoff volumes. By contrast, BRCs exhibited on average lower outflow TN concentrations (median reduction of 21 %) while DIN concentrations were similar between outflow and inflow. Hence, because they are generally more efficient in reducing N than P loads, BRCs tended to decrease the TN:TP and DIN:SRP ratios of stormwater runoff, potentially altering nutrient limitation patterns in receiving aquatic ecosystems. Changes to P and N speciation were also prevalent, with BRCs typically increasing the SRP:TP and (NO<inf>3</inf>–+NO<inf>2</inf>–):NH<inf>4</inf>+ ratios. Random forest modeling identified inflow concentrations and BRC age as key variables modulating the changes in TP, SRP, and TN concentrations between inflow and outflow. For DIN, the BRC's storage volume and drainage area also emerged as an important explanatory variable. Overall, our findings imply that the impacts of BRCs on the P and N concentrations, speciation, and loads of urban runoff are highly variable. Although the P and N loads in surface runoff are usually reduced by BRCs, the implications for downstream nutrient limitation and potential groundwater quality deterioration deserve further attention. © 2025",Bioretention cell; Machine learning; Nutrients export control; Urban stormwater management,Bioremediation; Elastin; Groundwater pollution; Bioretention cell; Export controls; Inorganics; Machine-learning; Nutrient export; Nutrient export control; Soluble reactive P; Storm water runoff; Stormwater best management practices; Urban stormwater management; Storm sewers; best management practice; database; machine learning; nitrogen; phosphorus; runoff; stormwater,,,,,"Water Resources Institute, University of Wisconsin, UW-WRI; Canada First Research Excellence Fund, CFREF; Water Research Foundation, WRF; American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (STPGP 521515-18)",Funding for this research was provided by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Strategic Partnership Grant (STPGP 521515-18) and the Canada First Excellence Research Fund (CFREF) through the Global Water Futures Program.

However, there is a scarcity of understanding of nighttime safety despite the fast-growing body of urban scene auditing research based on daytime street view imagery (SVI). To fill the gap, this study collected ∼1000 pairwise day-and-night SVIs to train a day-to-night (D2N) SVI generator to effectively predict nighttime SVI based on daytime counterpart using generative adversarial network (GAN). The accuracy of fake nighttime image was evaluated with commonly-used GAN metrics (e.g., structural similarity index, inception score) and human validation. Then, an online visual survey with 46 participants was conducted to collect their perceived safety on street scenes during daytime and nighttime (D&N), and the results become training labels for machine learning models to predict D&N safety perceptions. Our results revealed significant discrepancies in D&N safety perception. First, through correlation analysis, we found that the sky and building features matter to the prediction accuracy of generated nighttime SVIs. Second, the micro-level streetscape features (e.g., pavements, roads, and buildings) play influential roles in perceived safety. Third, higher safety perceptions are consistently found in areas with higher building density regardless of whether they are daytime or night. In contrast, untended trees and grass reduce perceived safety at night. This study provides a valuable reference for improving the accuracy of generating nighttime images from daytime SVIs. It also reveals how streetscapes affect D&N safety perceptions in high-density cities like Hong Kong, providing empirical evidence for urban design policies to facilitate nighttime attractiveness and prosperity. © 2024 The Authors",Day-to-night translation; Hong Kong; Nighttime urban scene; Safety perception; Street view imagery (SVI),,,,,,"University of Hong Kong, HKU","This research is supported by the University of Hong Kong's URC Seed Fund for Basic Research for New Staff, and Start-up Fund from Faculty of Architecture (FOA) and the Department of Urban Planning and Design (DUPAD).

Designed to analyze tweets related to crises, conflicts, and tragedies, the system maps emotional states to neuroemotion processes, enabling emotion-aware urban analytics for real-time monitoring of public sentiment in high-stress scenarios. By integrating a novel emotion-neuroemotion taxonomy, a specialized lexicon, and semi-automated annotation (Cohen’s kappa = 0.85), the framework bridges linguistic patterns with neurobiological insights to support data-driven urban decision-making in urban planning and public policy. Evaluated across multiple machine learning pipelines, the sustainable emotion detection Smart Urban System leverages LightGBM with Neuroemotion-Informed BERT embedding to achieve 98.57% accuracy, 0.9855 F1 score, and 1.0 AUC, outperforming traditional representations like TF-IDF and Word2Vec. While BERT-based models require greater computational resources, their superior performance justifies their use in urban smart infrastructure for emotion-aware applications, striking a balance between precision and scalability.

To effectively utilize AI-generative design results for spatial vitality creation and evaluation, exploring whether generated spaces respond to people’s emotional demands is necessary. This study establishes a comparative framework analyzing emotional attachment characteristics between LoRA-generated spatial designs and the real urban vitality space, using the representative case of THE BOX in Chaoyang, Beijing. Empirical data were collected through structured on-site surveys with 115 validated participants, enabling a comprehensive emotional attachment evaluation. SPSS 26.0 was employed for multi-dimensional analyses, encompassing aggregate attachment intensity, dimensional differentiation, and correlation mapping. Key findings reveal that while both generative and original spatial representations elicit measurable positive responses, AI-generated designs demonstrate a limited capacity to replicate the authentic three-dimensional experiential qualities inherent to physical environments, particularly regarding structural articulation and material tactility. Furthermore, significant deficiencies persist in the generative design’s cultural semiotic expression and visual-interactive spatial legibility, resulting in diminished user satisfaction. The analysis reveals that LoRA-generated spatial solutions require strategic enhancements in dynamic visual hierarchy, interactive integration, chromatic optimization, and material fidelity to bridge this experiential gap. These insights suggest viable pathways for integrating generative AI methodologies with conventional urban design practices, potentially enabling more sophisticated hybrid approaches that synergize digital innovation with built environment realities to cultivate enriched multisensory spatial experiences. © 2025 by the authors.",AI-generative design; emotional attachment scales; emotional design; LoRA technology; urban vitality space,artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; research; urban design; urban planning; Chaoyang; China; Liaoning,,,,,"Beijing Forestry University, BJFU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (52208005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF; Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation, (22GLC063, 230805329162932); Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation","Funding text 1: We would like to thank to all the people including onsite users and online participants for supporting our research.

Focusing on Fangzhou Ancient City, we address historical spatial degradation caused by excessive industrialization and disordered urban expansion. A methodological framework is proposed, combining low-altitude UAV-derived high-density point cloud data with RandLA-Net for semi-automatic semantic segmentation of buildings, vegetation, and roads by integrating multispectral and geometric attributes. Key findings reveal: (1) Modern buildings’ abnormal elevation in steep slopes disrupts the plateau–city visual corridor; (2) Statistical analysis shows significant morphological disparities between historical and modern streets; (3) Modern structures exceed traditional height limits, while divergent roof slopes aggravate aesthetic fragmentation. This multi-level spatial analysis offers a paradigm for quantifying historical urban spaces and validates deep learning’s feasibility in heritage spatial analytics, providing insights for balancing conservation and development in ecologically fragile areas. © 2025 by the authors.",cultural heritage preservation; historic urban landscape; point cloud classification; RandLA-Net; three-dimensional spatial analysis,aerial survey; building; classification; feasibility study; gully; heritage conservation; industrialization; landscape structure; model validation; segmentation; spatial analysis; spectral analysis; three-dimensional modeling; unmanned vehicle; urban history; China,,,,,,,"Mahmoudi Farahani, Leila, Contextualizing palimpsest of collective memory in an urban heritage site: Case study of Chahar Bagh, Shiraz - Iran, Archnet-IJAR: International Journal of Architectural Research, 9, 1, pp. 218-231, (2015); Khalaf, Roha W., A Proposal to Apply the Historic Urban Landscape Approach to Reconstruction in the World Heritage Context, Historic Environment: Policy and Practice, 9, 1, pp. 39-52, (2018); Jiang, Jun, Urban Heritage Conservation and Modern Urban Development from the Perspective of the Historic Urban Landscape Approach: A Case Study of Suzhou, Land, 11, 8, (2022); Wang, Shaoxu, Pingyao: The historic urban landscape and planning for heritage-led urban changes, Cities, 97, (2020); Vienna Memorandum on World Heritage and Contemporary Architecture Managing the Historic Urban Landscape, (2005); Unescos World Heritage City Lab, (2025); He, Qingsong, Evaluating historic preservation zoning using a landscape approach, Land Use Policy, 109, (2021); Liu, Tianhang, Evaluation of public perceptions of authenticity of urban heritage under the conservation paradigm of Historic Urban Landscape—a case study of the Five Avenues Historic District in Tianjin, China, Journal of Architectural Conservation, 25, 3, pp. 228-251, (2019); Oumelkheir, Boukratem, Assessment process in the delimitation of historic urban landscape of Algiers by AHP, Miscellanea Geographica, 25, 2, pp. 110-126, (2021); Zhao, Xiaoxin, The role of digital technologies in recording values of human settlements: testing a practical Historic Urban Landscape approach in China and India, Digital Creativity, 32, 4, pp. 253-274, (2021)","K.

Tehran, a metropolis under mounting water stress, exemplifies this global crisis. With population pressures, migration, poor urban planning, and inadequate environmental management intensifying the demand for water, reliance on groundwater surged to over 51 % of the city's total supply by 2021. This unsustainable dependence is compounded by severe aquifer depletion, now declining at an alarming rate of 32 cm annually. This study adopts advanced machine learning approaches to provide a forward-looking, integrative approach to understanding and mitigating the impacts of urban centralization, land-use mismanagement, and climate variability on Tehran's water resources. By leveraging hybrid simulation models, combining Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models with three optimization techniques (i.e. Fire Hawk Optimizer (FHO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Horse Optimization Algorithm (HOA)) this research offers a powerful tool for managing water allocation across five critical dam reservoirs and the Tehran aquifer. Our analysis reveals that the RNN-FHO model demonstrates superior performance in predicting dam inflows, while the RNN-WOA model excels in forecasting groundwater table fluctuations, providing a vital roadmap for water resource planners. We developed a robust conceptual model to address anticipated drinking water shortages by supplementing surface water with groundwater resources. To simulate future conditions, we employed three state-of-the-art climate models (MRI-ESM2, CNRM-CM6-1, and BCC-CSM2) across three emission pathways (SSP1.26, SSP2.45, and SSP5.85) for the period 2021–2050. The projections indicate a troubling trend: dam inflows could decline by 8% in the most optimistic scenario and by 11 % in the worst case. Furthermore, by 2030, water demand in Tehran is expected to exceed 2.2 BCM, intensifying pressure on groundwater resources and necessitating large-scale water transfers. Excessive groundwater extraction, ranging from 100 to 300 MCM, would result in drastic aquifer drawdowns of 46–171 cm, threatening both hydrological stability and environmental health. This study highlights the critical need for a paradigm shift in water management practices. A strategic approach, encompassing reductions in per capita water consumption, extensive recycling, improved use of treated effluent in urban landscapes, and optimized water allocation, is essential to avert a looming water crisis. The methodologies and insights presented in this study offer transformative solutions for water-stressed urban environments worldwide. © 2025 The Authors",Adaptation strategy; Aquifer recharge; Climate change; Climate models; Water resource allocation; Water resource imbalance,"Estuaries; Global warming; Highway administration; Lakes; Recharging (underground waters); Resource allocation; Rivers; Runoff; Strategic planning; Adaptation strategies; Aquifer recharge; Neural-networks; Optimization algorithms; Optimizers; Water allocations; Water resource allocation; Water resource imbalance; Water shortages; Waters resources; Aquifers; drinking water; ground water; surface water; climate change; environmental management; machine learning; paradigm shift; recharge; water demand; water management; water resource; aquifer; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; centralization; city planning; climate model; conceptual model; controlled study; convolutional neural network; dam (barrier); deep learning; deep neural network; drought; effluent; environmental health; fire hawk algorithm; forecasting; groundwater depletion; horse optimization algorithm; land use; landscape; long short term memory network; machine learning algorithm; megalopolis; metropolitan area; prediction; recurrent neural network; recycling; resource allocation; simulation; sustainable development; urban area; urbanization; water supply; whale optimization algorithm; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Climate Change; Deep Learning; Drinking Water; Groundwater; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Resources; Water Supply",,Drinking Water,,,"University of Warwick; Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/S007350/1); Natural Environment Research Council, NERC",The authors acknowledge resources and support from the Scientific Computing Research Technology Platform (SCRTP) at the University of Warwick.

These dynamic transformations demand timely and effective landscape classifications to track environmental, demographic, and socio-economic developments and for a deeper understanding of human settlements and their sustainability impacts. Traditional threshold-based classification methods, while widely used, rely heavily on expert knowledge and require substantial human input, posing challenges for rapid updates to rural–urban classifications. This study addresses these limitations by leveraging an unsupervised learning neural network to classify territorial typologies in Switzerland at a granular municipal level. Using a comprehensive dataset that integrates physical, demographic, and socio-economic variables, we identified six distinct clusters, which were subsequently mapped onto the geographical space, providing a characterization of the Swiss landscape through its intricate rural–urban interface, urban expansion frontiers, and aging populations in peri-urban and rural areas. Our analysis also highlights critical phenomena such as agricultural land loss and the encroachment into ecologically sensitive Alpine territories. Graphical outputs, such as heatmaps and boxplots, were used as effective visual tools to aid in results interpretation, uncover variables distributions and relationships, and enhance the analytical process. The findings demonstrate that clustering procedures based on unsupervised machine learning provide valuable insights into rural–urban configurations and contemporary urbanization processes, offering a robust framework for studying the interplay between human settlements and environmental sustainability, particularly in vulnerable Alpine regions. © The Author(s) 2025.",Census data; Clustering; Neural network; Rural–urban interface; Switzerland,Hierarchical clustering; Population statistics; Stockpile surveys; Urban planning; Census data; Clusterings; Human settlements; Learning approach; Neural-networks; Rural–urban interface; Switzerland; Urban and rural; Urban expansion; Urban landscape; Unsupervised learning; artificial neural network; census; cluster analysis; human settlement; machine learning; periurban area; rural-urban comparison; sustainability; territoriality; unsupervised classification,,,,,"Université de Lausanne, UNIL",Open access funding provided by University of Lausanne.,"Abrantes, Patrícia Catarina, Modelling urban form: A multidimensional typology of urban occupation for spatial analysis, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 46, 1, pp. 47-65, (2019); Wandl, Alexander, Beyond urban-rural classifications: Characterising and mapping territories-in-between across Europe, Landscape and Urban Planning, 130, 1, pp. 50-63, (2014); Alexiou, Alexandros, A classification of multidimensional open data for urban morphology, Built Environment, 42, 3, pp. 382-395, (2016); Amato, Federico, Spatiotemporal data science: theoretical advances and applications, Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 36, 8, pp. 2027-2029, (2022); Amin, Gomal, Assessment of Machine Learning Algorithms for Land Cover Classification in a Complex Mountainous Landscape, Journal of Geovisualization and Spatial Analysis, 8, 2, (2024); Aydin, Orhun, A quantitative comparison of regionalization methods, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 35, 11, pp. 2287-2315, (2021); Advances in Spatial Econometrics Methodology Tools and Applications, (2004); Bickel, Valentin Tertius, Decadal Surface Changes and Displacements in Switzerland, Journal of Geovisualization and Spatial Analysis, 6, 2, (2022); Cao, Hui, Differentiation of urban-rural interface and its driving mechanism: A case study of Nanjing, China, Land Use Policy, 140, (2024); Cattivelli, Valentina, Methods for the identification of urban, rural and peri-urban areas in Europe: An overview, Journal of Urban Regeneration and Renewal, 14, 3, pp. 240-246, (2021)","M.

This notion encompasses concepts such as the 5-minute city, 10-minute city, 15-minute city, and 20-minute city. It has emerged as a novel approach in urban design and planning, focusing on sustainable, smart, and and climate-resilient cities characterized by proximity and efficient accessibility. Despite this growing interest, there is a lack of a literature review on this notion. This study employs bibliometric analysis techniques utilizing Bibliometrix and VOSviewer software tools to analyze bibliographic data, identify trending topics and terms, identify research gaps, and explore future research directions. The findings showed that interest in X-minute cities began with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and intensified as the pandemic affected urban communities worldwide. Results showed that topics such as accessibility, mobility, food, walkability, quality of life, and smart city have garnered relatively more attention. Separate analyses of articles related to X-minute cities, 15-minute cities, and 20-minute showed that the thematic focus of 15-minute and 20-minute cities is different. The most important clusters identified by co-occurrence analysis for X-minute cities, 15-minute cities, and 20-minute cities were urban planning and neighborhoods, mobility and accessibility, and socioeconomic aspects, respectively. Based on the findings, we identified nine future research directions that require further development. Among other things, future research should pay more attention to implementation challenges and topics related to energy, artificial intelligence, public preferences, health, and regulations. The results of this research contribute to the advancement and development of the notion of X-minute cities, enhancing its integration into both practice and theory. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Fifteen-minute cities; Proximity; Sustainable urbanism; Twenty-minute cities; Urban planning and design; X-minute cities,literature review; sustainability; urban area; urban design; urban planning,,,,,,,"15 Minute City Quantified Using Mobility Data, (2022); Abbiasov, Timur, The 15-minute city quantified using human mobility data, Nature Human Behaviour, 8, 3, pp. 445-455, (2024); Asian Journal of Research in Education and Social Sciences, (2023); Adibhesami, Mohammad Anvar, Effect of urban design on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mahabad, Iran, Cities and Health, (2024); Alberti, Francesco, From the Neighbourhood Unit to the 15-Minute City.

To assess the impact of UBE on PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution, this study quantitatively evaluates the relationship between them. First, given the limitation that current PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration collection mainly relies on fixed monitoring stations, this study set up a taxi mobile monitoring system. Second, aiming at the deficiency of traditional extraction mostly based on remote sensing imagery, this study proposed a deep learning-based method to calculate the green and sky visibility index. Pearson's preliminary correlation analysis showed that climate factors were most correlated to changes in PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration. Furthermore, the prediction effects of nine mainstream machine learning methods were compared. The results showed that (1) The overall prediction performance of summer (R2 = 0.92) and autumn (R2 = 0.93) outperformed the one of spring (R2 = 0.88) and winter (R2 = 0.86) seasons. (2) The Random Forest and LightGBM models obtained optimal predictions with R2 of 0.907 and 0.916, respectively. (3) The complex nonlinear relationship between the UBE and PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration needed to be captured by the Shapley additive explanations method. The findings suggested controlling the space enclosure index between 0.08 and 0.15, plot area ratio within 0.5, and building density within 0.2.

There is a need for knowledge on how the spatial network design, a signature of urban areas, is associated with poverty. This paper addresses this need by combining conventional theory-driven and emerging data-driven methods. We computed a multidimensional poverty index -MPI using geocoded household survey data in Kenya, which was treated as the dependent variable (target). The spatial Design Network Analysis (DNA) plug-in in ArcGIS Pro was used to quantify metrics of the spatial network design from a road network dataset of the study area, which was treated as the independent variables (features). We used the capability approach to provide a theoretical basis linking the social and physical network attributes. We then applied logistic regression and a machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, to analyse the network predictors of multidimensional poverty while controlling for confounders. The results of the logistic regression suggested that network density had the largest magnitude of margins (−1.004), which is significant at (p < 0.01) and negatively associated with multidimensional poverty. In contrast, results from the XGBoost algorithm suggested that network efficiency was the most important feature of the road network, with an impact of 16 percentage points. Severance and betweenness were among the top five important features of the network in both logistic regression and XGBoost. The situation of a household in either a formal or informal settlement was the most important confounder in both models. The results suggest that theory-driven logistic regression outperforms the machine learning algorithm based on our data and method. The logistic regression had an AUC of 0.794 compared to 0.692 in XGBoost. Our paper contributes to the knowledge about the association between spatial network design and multidimensional poverty, which helps improve our hypothesis and informs our theory. In addition, the results reveal the spatial design features that planners and policymakers should pay attention to in urban areas. We propose further research considering spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence in the analysis. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Logistic regression; Machine learning; Multidimensional poverty; Spatial network design,ArcGIS; comparative study; household survey; machine learning; network analysis; poverty; regression analysis; urban design; Kenya,,,,,,,"15 Minute City Quantified Using Mobility Data, (2022); Ahmed, Abubakari, Patterns and determinants of multidimensional poverty in secondary cities: Implications for urban sustainability in African cities, Habitat International, 134, (2023); Valuing Freedoms Sen S Capability Approach and Poverty Reduction, (2002); Alkire, Sabina, Counting and multidimensional poverty measurement, Journal of Public Economics, 95, 7-8, pp. 476-487, (2011); Multidimensional Poverty Measurement and Analysis, (2015); Alnahit, Ali O., Stream water quality prediction using boosted regression tree and random forest models, Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 36, 9, pp. 2661-2680, (2022); Arcaute, Elsa, Cities and regions in Britain through hierarchical percolation, Royal Society Open Science, 3, 4, (2016); A New Theory of Space Syntax, (2004); Benita, Francisco J., Social Backwardness in Mexico City Metropolitan Area, Social Indicators Research, 126, 1, pp. 141-160, (2016); Benita, Francisco J., A New Measure of Transport Disadvantage for the Developing World Using Free Smartphone Data, Social Indicators Research, 145, 1, pp. 415-435, (2019)","J.

However, despite growing scholarly interest, existing research fails to provide a thorough understanding of their development and evolution. This study addresses this gap by analyzing 624 documents on urban hubs published between 2000 and 2024 through a bibliometric approach. The research synthesizes the concept of urban hubs, examines their effects, and reviews key design elements. It highlights how the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly influenced urban hub planning, particularly in location optimization and spatial design. Through a detailed literature review, the study identifies key research gaps, including the lack of quantitative methods to assess urban hubs’ impacts, the need for demographic and long-term health considerations, insufficient focus on environmental goals like resilience and low-carbon design, and the limited application of AI techniques in generating 3D spatial functions. The study proposes a comprehensive AI-driven research framework that integrates social, economic, and environmental factors to enhance urban hub planning. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners, offering a pathway for the future development of sustainable urban hubs. © 2025",Artificial intelligence; Bibliometric analysis; Effects evaluation; Spatial design; Urban hubs,artificial intelligence; environmental factor; optimization; spatial analysis; sustainability; urban design; urban planning; urban policy; urban transport; valuation,,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2023YFC3807505); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; (2022YFC3800205)","Funding text 1: This research was funded by The National Key Research and Development Program of China (Project No. 2023YFC3807505) from Ministry of Science and Technology of China.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by 'Basic Theory of Sustainable Urban Planning, Construction, and Governance' under the 14th Five-Year Plan of the State Key Research and Development Program of the People's Republic of China (grant number 2022YFC3800205) and National Key R&D Program of China (grant number 2023YFC3807505).","undefined, (2018); Alirol, Emilie, Urbanisation and infectious diseases in a globalised world, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 11, 2, pp. 131-141, (2011); Alumur, Sibel A., Network hub location problems: The state of the art, European Journal of Operational Research, 190, 1, pp. 1-21, (2008); Alumur, Sibel A., A hub covering network design problem for cargo applications in Turkey, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 60, 10, pp. 1349-1359, (2009); Ambrosino, Giorgio, Enabling intermodal urban transport through complementary services: From Flexible Mobility Services to the Shared Use Mobility Agency: Workshop 4.

Existing studies mostly focus on single dimensions (e.g., vegetation ratio), lacking a large-scale integrated analysis of urban color and visual elements. To address this gap, this study employs semantic segmentation and color computation on a massive street-view image dataset encompassing 56 cities worldwide, comparing eight machine learning models in predicting Visual Aesthetic Perception Scores (VAPSs). The results indicate that LightGBM achieves the best overall performance. To unpack this “black-box” prediction, we adopt an interpretable ensemble approach by combining LightGBM with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAPs). SHAP assigns each feature a quantitative contribution to the model’s output, enabling transparent, post hoc explanations of how individual color metrics and visual elements drive VAPS. Our findings suggest that the vegetation ratio contributes the most to VAPS, but once greening surpasses a certain threshold, a “saturation effect” emerges and can no longer continuously enhance visual appeal. Excessive Sky Visibility Ratio can reduce VAPS. Moderate road visibility may increase spatial layering and vibrancy, whereas overly dense building significantly degrades overall aesthetic quality. While keeping the dominant color focused, moderate color saturation and complexity can increase the attractiveness of street views more effectively than overly uniform color schemes. Our research not only offers a comprehensve quantitative basis for urban visual aesthetics, but also underscores the importance of balancing color composition and visual elements, offering practical recommendations for public space planning, design, and color configuration. © 2025 by the authors.",machine learning; Place Pulse 2.0; street-view visual elements; urban aesthetics; urban color,color; ensemble forecasting; machine learning; urban design; urban development; urban renewal; visual analysis,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (524B2110); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC",This study is financed by The Project Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China No. 524B2110 and Shanghai Intelligent Science and Technology IV Summit Discipline Cross-Innovation Science and Education Integration Fund.,"Chen, Zeyin, Heat and mobility: Machine learning perspectives on bike-sharing resilience in Shanghai, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 142, (2025); Li, Xu, Urban Architectural Color Evaluation: A Cognitive Framework Combining Machine Learning and Human Perception, Buildings, 14, 12, (2024); Tosca, Theano Fannie, Environmental colour design for the third millennium: An evolutionary standpoint, Color Research and Application, 27, 6, pp. 441-454, (2002); Zhang, Chi, Quantifying architectural color Quality: A Machine learning integrated framework driven by quantitative color metrics, Ecological Indicators, 157, (2023); J Public Space, (2018); Tuijin Jishu J Propuls Technol, (2023); Jeong, Jin Su, The visual evaluation of rural areas: A methodological approach for the spatial planning and color design of scattered second homes with an example in Hervás, Western Spain, Land Use Policy, 46, pp. 330-340, (2015); Mehanna, Walaa Abou El Haggag, Urban renewal for traditional commercial streets at the historical centers of cities, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 58, 4, pp. 1127-1143, (2019); Bian, Wenjuan, Study on the Characteristics and the Causes of Urban Color Evolution Based on New Contextualism, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 189, 6, (2018); Park, Keunhyun, Street life and the built environment in an auto-oriented US region, Cities, 88, pp. 243-251, (2019)","Z.

Multi-source data (3D morphological metrics, LCZ classifications, mobile measurements) were integrated with deep learning-derived street-level GVI through image analysis. A random forest-multiple regression hybrid model evaluated spatiotemporal variations and GVI impacts across time, street orientation, and urban-rural gradients. Key findings include: (1) Urban street Ta prediction model: Daytime model: R2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.33 °C; Nighttime model: R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.42 °C. (2) GVI shows significant inverse association with temperature, A 0.1 unit increase in GVI reduced temperatures by 0.124°C during the day and 0.020 °C at night. (3) Orientation effects: North–south streets exhibit strongest cooling (1.85 °C daytime reduction), followed by east–west; northeast–southwest layouts show negligible impact; (4) Canyon geometry: Low-aspect canyons (H/W < 1) enhance cooling efficiency, while high-aspect canyons (H/W > 2) retain nocturnal heat despite daytime cooling; (5) Urban-rural gradient: Cooling peaks in urban-fringe zones (10–15 km daytime, 15–20 km nighttime), contrasting with persistent nocturnal warmth in urban cores (0–5 km); (6) LCZ variability: Daytime cooling intensity peaks in LCZ3, nighttime in LCZ6. These findings offer scientific evidence and empirical support for urban thermal environment optimization strategies in urban planning and landscape design.

Although previous studies have explored UHIs in Tehran, a comprehensive analysis remains lacking. This study adopts a macro-scale approach, combining linear, non-linear, and location-based methods to investigate key factors influencing UHI intensity (UHII) in detail. It uses remote sensing and machine learning to analyze UHIs in Tehran by examining Land Surface Temperature and Land Cover data within GIS. The study compares urban temperatures with those in surrounding rural areas and identifies key factors influencing UHIs through ordinary least squares (OLS), random forest (RF), and geographically weighted regression. The findings reveal substantial UHII variations across Tehran, with central districts showing temperature differences greater than 5 °C compared to rural areas. The OLS model identifies aerosol optical depth (0.38), population density (0.45), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) (0.17) as contributors to higher UHII, while relative humidity (-0.51) and terrain slope (-0.22) are linked to lower UHII. The RF model, with a Mean Squared Error of 0.33 and an R-squared value of 0.84, highlights population density, relative humidity, and NDBI as primary factors influencing UHII.

While predictive models like deep learning and Markov models offer insights into individual mobility, they often struggle with out-of-routine behaviors. Our study introduces an approach that dynamically integrates individual and collective mobility behaviors, leveraging collective intelligence to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluating the model on millions of privacy-preserving trajectories across five US cities, we demonstrate its superior performance in predicting out-of-routine mobility, surpassing even advanced deep learning methods. The spatial analysis highlights the model’s effectiveness near urban areas with a high density of points of interest, where collective behaviors strongly influence mobility. During disruptive events like the COVID-19 pandemic, our model retains predictive capabilities, unlike individual-based models. By bridging the gap between individual and collective behaviors, our approach offers transparent and accurate predictions, which are crucial for addressing contemporary mobility challenges. © © 2025 the Author(s).",collective behavior; generalization; GPS Data; human mobility,"accuracy; Article; behavior; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; human; intelligence; predictive model; spatial analysis; city; epidemiology; pandemic; population dynamics; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; theoretical model; United States; Cities; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Population Dynamics; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,"European Commission, EC; (IR0000013, 3264 on 28/12/2021, CN00000013); (CUP B53D23012770006, 20224CZ5X4_PE6_PRIN 2022); (101120237); (PE00000013)","Funding text 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

T<inf>mrt</inf> is heavily influenced by urban morphology, including building layout, street design, and green spaces which alter airflow, shading, and heat retention. Evaluating geometry alternatives during the early design stages in urban neighborhoods is challenging due to lengthy simulations and the need for extensive expertise in physical models. Recent studies have employed data-driven methods for quick design comparisons and new urban layout evaluations, successfully predicting Thermal indicators of Urban heat Island phenomenon but often limited by the diversity of urban configurations inputs used in training datasets. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel framework that uses machine learning models to predict T<inf>mrt</inf> as the primary indicator. A comprehensive training dataset of 200 cases was generated in Rhino7 using Grasshopper, Ladybug, and Dragonfly plugins. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of input uncertainties on model predictions, and the model's performance was validated against unseen configurations. Among six machine learning algorithms tested, the CatBoost Regressor achieved the highest accuracy, predicting T<inf>mrt</inf> with an R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 4.30 °C, and MAE = 2.34 °C. Validation using 20 additional cases showed an accuracy of R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 3.34 °C, and MAE = 2.27 °C in predicting T<inf>mrt</inf> heat maps for new urban configurations. This framework successfully enables real-time T<inf>mrt</inf> heat map analysis in simplified cubic neighborhoods within a 3D environment. Additionally, it enhances the temporal and spatial resolution of thermal patterns predictions, offering rapid and detailed insights into various urban design alternatives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Catboost Regressor; Data-Driven Methods; Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt); Urban Design; Urban Environmental Comfort,Sensitivity analysis; Catboost regressor; Data-driven methods; Environmental comfort; Mean radiant temperature; Thermal; Urban configurations; Urban design; Urban environmental comfort; Urban heat island; Thermal modeling,,,,,,,"Shashua-Bar, Limor, Vegetation as a climatic component in the design of an urban street.

This study employs advanced techniques, including satellite imagery analysis and Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-Markov) modelling, to forecast urban expansion in Tehran, Iran, up to the year 2035. While the study is geographically focused on Tehran, the methodologies and insights can be adapted to other rapidly urbanizing regions facing similar challenges. Leveraging satellite imagery (2000–2023), the research delineates Tehran’s historical urban growth and projects future land use change. The study uses supervised machine learning algorithms for classification and CA-Markov modeling to simulate future urban dynamics. The study generates a simulated map for 2035, offering insights into the potential spatial distribution of built-up areas, bare land, water bodies, and vegetation. The findings reveal significant urban expansion, driven by population growth, economic development, and infrastructure expansion. The built-up area is projected to grow significantly due to rapid urbanization, while bare land and vegetation cover will decrease, highlighting the environmental pressures of urban expansion. The study also observes minor effects on water bodies, reflecting the subtle impact of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems. This analysis enhances the understanding of the socio-economic, policy, and environmental factors shaping Tehran’s urban landscape. It offers valuable insights for developing sustainable development strategies and provides a model for assessing urban growth dynamics, contributing to global urban sustainability discussions and offering tools for urban planners worldwide. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Cellular automata Markov chain; Land cover; Random forest; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Tehran; Urban growth,algorithm; aquatic ecosystem; cellular automaton; economic development; infrastructure planning; land cover; land use change; machine learning; population growth; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sustainable development; urban growth; urbanization; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)],,,,,,,"Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Data Science, (2020); Al-Sharif, Abubakr A.A., Urban Sprawl Analysis of Tripoli Metropolitan City (Libya) Using Remote Sensing Data and Multivariate Logistic Regression Model, Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing, 42, 1, pp. 149-163, (2014); Angel, Shlomo, The dimensions of global urban expansion: Estimates and projections for all countries, 2000-2050, Progress in Planning, 75, 2, pp. 53-107, (2011); Atlas of Urban Expansion, (2012); Azabdaftari, Anali, Predicting urban tomorrow: CA-Markov modeling and district evolution, Earth Science Informatics, 17, 4, pp. 3215-3232, (2024); Barredo, Ji, Towards a set of IPCC SRES urban land use scenarios: Modelling urban land use in the Madrid region, Environmental Science and Engineering, 9783540684893, pp. 363-385, (2008); New Science of Cities, (2013); Batty, Michael J., From cells to cities, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 21, Celebration Issue, pp. 531-548, (1994); Batty, Michael J., Smart cities of the future, European Physical Journal: Special Topics, 214, 1, pp. 481-518, (2012); Benenson, Itzhak, Geosimulation: Automata-based Modeling of Urban Phenomena, pp. 1-287, (2006)","A.

This study aims to explore the optimization path of urban landscape design through the integration of thermodynamics and machine learning, with a particular focus on the integrated application of thermal energy cycle and ecological cycle. This study constructed an urban thermodynamic model based on thermodynamic laws, and clarified the distribution and cycling characteristics of thermal energy in urban ecosystems by defining urban thermodynamic entropy and conducting thermal radiation analysis. At the same time, machine learning technology was used for urban feature extraction, and semantic extraction and model performance analysis were conducted based on theoretical foundations to accurately identify the heat flow patterns in the city. This study proposes an optimization strategy for urban landscape design that integrates thermal and ecological cycles. By identifying urban ecological units and cycling patterns, combined with the specific characteristics of the city, design optimization schemes have been developed for different urban environments. These plans aim to enhance the comfort and ecological sustainability of urban thermal environments. Research has shown that by integrating thermodynamic models with machine learning techniques, the scientificity and adaptability of urban landscape design can be effectively improved, which can help alleviate the urban heat island effect, promote the restoration and development of the ecological environment, and provide new perspectives and practical paths for future urban planning. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Ecological cycle; Integrated application; Machine learning; Optimization research; Thermal energy cycle; Thermodynamic model; Urban landscape design,Ecological cycles; Energy cycle; Integrated applications; Landscape design; Machine-learning; Optimization researches; Thermal; Thermal energy cycle; Thermodynamic modelling; Urban landscape; Urban landscape design,,,,,(2023 J0709),This work was supported by Scientific Research Fund of Education Department of Yunnan Province: Study on Cold Island Effect of Park Green Space and Its Influencing Factors in Kunming (No.2023\u202FJ0709).,"Lai, Dayi, A review of mitigating strategies to improve the thermal environment and thermal comfort in urban outdoor spaces, Science of the Total Environment, 661, pp. 337-353, (2019); Mavromatidis, Lazaros Elias, Constructal macroscale thermodynamic model of spherical urban greenhouse form with double thermal envelope within heat currents, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 14, (2019); Jordan, Michael I., Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects, Science, 349, 6245, pp. 255-260, (2015); Donihue, Colin M., Adaptive evolution in urban ecosystems, Ambio, 44, 3, pp. 194-203, (2015); Sugar, Lorraine, Thermodynamics of urban growth revealed by city scaling, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 557, (2020); Aramendia, Julene, Spectroscopic speciation and thermodynamic modeling to explain the degradation of weathering steel surfaces in SO2 rich urban atmospheres, Microchemical Journal, 115, pp. 138-145, (2014); Semenyuk, Olga N., Integrated Urban Design, Civil Engineering and Architecture, 10, 4, pp. 1631-1640, (2022); Wang, Qingqing, Ecological circular agriculture: A case study evaluating biogas slurry applied to rice in two soils, Chemosphere, 301, (2022); Addison, Jane, Applying the social–ecological systems framework to the evaluation and design of payment for ecosystem service schemes in the Eurasian steppe, Biodiversity and Conservation, 25, 12, pp. 2421-2440, (2016); Chang, Yuan, Design of Rural Human Settlement Unit with the Integration of Production-Living-Ecology of China Based on Dynamic Emergy Analysis, Buildings, 13, 3, (2023)","L.

Given the resource-intensive nature of gathering evaluations on urban attractiveness through surveys or inquiries from residents, there is a constant quest for automated solutions to streamline this process and support spatial planning. In this study, we applied an off-the-shelf AI model to automate the analysis of urban attractiveness, using over 1800 Google Street View images of Helsinki, Finland. By incorporating the GPT-4 model, we assessed these images through three criteria-based prompts. Simultaneously, 24 participants, categorised into residents and non-residents, were asked to rate the images. To gain insights into the non-transparent decision-making processes of GPT-4, we employed semantic segmentation to explore how the model uses different image features. Our results demonstrated a strong alignment between GPT-4 and participant ratings, although geographic disparities were noted. Specifically, GPT-4 showed a preference for suburban areas with significant greenery, contrasting with participants who found these areas less attractive. Conversely, in the city centre and densely populated urban regions of Helsinki, GPT-4 assigned lower attractiveness scores than participant ratings. The semantic segmentation analysis revealed that GPT-4's ratings were primarily influenced by physical features like vegetation, buildings, and sidewalk. While there was general agreement between AI and human assessments across various locations, GPT-4 struggled to incorporate contextual nuances into its ratings, unlike participants, who considered both context and features of the urban environment. The study suggests that leveraging AI models like GPT-4 allows spatial planners to gather insights into the attractiveness of different areas efficiently. However, caution is necessary, while we used an off-the-shelf model, it is crucial to develop models specifically trained to understand the local context. Although AI models provide valuable insights, human perspectives are essential for a comprehensive understanding of urban attractiveness. © 2024",AI-human comparison; Multimodal large language models; Spatial planning; Street view imagery; Urban design,Decision making; Geological surveys; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Urban planning; AI-human comparison; Helsinki; Language model; Multi-modal; Multimodal large language model; Semantic segmentation; Spatial planning; Street view imagery; Urban design; Urban environments; artificial intelligence; comparative study; imagery; software; spatial planning; urban design; urban region; Finland; Varsinais-Suomi,,,,,"Helsingin Yliopisto, HY; European Commission, EC; European Research Council, ERC, (101044906); European Research Council, ERC","Funding text 1: This study is part of the GREENTRAVEL project (2023-2027) funded by the European Union (ERC, project 101044906).

Particularly, the recognition of urban thermal hotspots is crucial for adding effective cooling interventions for mitigation and avoiding overheating in newly built areas. However, the hotspots and associated drivers vary across time and space, bringing challenges to urban planners to make win-win decisions to synchronously address diurnal and nocturnal heat stresses through an integrated set of cooling strategies. This study aims to recognize the homogeneity and heterogeneity of diurnal and nocturnal hotspots and interpret principal and synergetic drivers behind them by developing a robust methodological scheme in addressing uncertainties associated with temperature data and analytical models. It explicitly 1) identified summer diurnal and nocturnal hotspots using rigorously screened satellite data; 2) recognized the typical typologies of hotspot-prone urban landscape according to urban composition, morphology, and function; 3) explored the day-night similarities and disparities in major urban factors and their robust effective ranges for synergetic mitigation through multi-model non-linear analysis with diverse machine learning techniques covering random forest, gradient boosting machines, and boosted regression trees. Results revealed that the specific locations and typical urban landscape features varied between diurnal and nocturnal hotspots. Among the six typologies recognized, industrial-dominated ones were more inclined to emerge as diurnal hotspots, while mid- to high-rise and mid-density blocks, with diversified land uses (mostly residential-dominated), tended to become diurnal, and more likely, nocturnal hotspots. All three models reached robust conclusion that urban morphology exhibited significant influence on both diurnal and nocturnal hotspot formation. Although trade-offs remained unavoidable in many cases, synergetic mitigation could be achieved through optimizing area averaged building height below 15 m or above 25 m, and building volume density under 2 % for Wuhan, China. Overall, this study responds to the emerging multidimensional urban science and praxis and extends the conventional one-dimensional planning against urban heat to win-win decisions over both diurnal and nocturnal hotspots. The empirical findings can benefit the development of complete, unbiased, and implementable actions for enhanced climate-resilience. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Climate-resilience; Co-benefits; Diurnal and nocturnal hotspots; Multi-model analysis; Synergetic mitigation; Urban surface thermal environment,Adaptive boosting; Urban planning; Climate-resilience; Cobenefits; Diurnal and nocturnal hotspot; Hotspots; Modeling analyzes; Multi-model analyze; Multi-modelling; Synergetic mitigation; Synergetics; Thermal environment; Urban surface thermal environment; Urban surfaces; Decision trees; air temperature; climate modeling; heat island; heterogeneity; homogeneity; urban planning; China; Hubei; Wuhan,,,,,"(LBXT2023YB04); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52078389, 52308079, 42301339); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; (20240302); (GHKF-202301); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (2023AFB080); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province; China Meteorological Administration, CMA, (CMA2024QN15); China Meteorological Administration, CMA","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52308079 , 42301339 , 52078389 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province ( 2023AFB080 ), Key Laboratory of Spatial Intelligent Planning Technology, Ministry of Natural Resources ( 20240302 ), Key Laboratory of Earth Surface System and Human-Earth Relations ( LBXT2023YB04 ), Tianjin Key Laboratory of Smart City Planning ( GHKF-202301 ), and the China Meteorological Administration \u201CResearch on value realization of climate ecological products\u201D Youth Innovation Team Project (No. CMA2024QN15 ).","Acuto, Michele, Building a global urban science, Nature Sustainability, 1, 1, pp. 2-4, (2018); Anselin, Luc E., GeoDa: An introduction to spatial data analysis, Geographical Analysis, 38, 1, pp. 5-22, (2006); Apley, Daniel W., Visualizing the effects of predictor variables in black box supervised learning models, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

This problem is important and topical and has many implications for decision-makers across multiple sectors, such as urban design, urban climate, agriculture, transportation, energy, and disaster management. This problem involves selecting a small subset of data (specific days) from the original large dataset (decades long), such that it captures the essential information and characteristics of the large dataset, while minimizing redundancy. This is useful as it makes the dataset more manageable for processing, analysis, and insight gathering without degrading the overall quality of the information content. We develop a novel algorithm that is based on advanced machine learning and optimization techniques and consists of two stages: (1) spatial dimensionality reduction (SDR) to reduce the number of spatial cells analyzed while preserving as much relevant information as possible and (2) representative subset selection (RSS) to find a small subset of days in the dataset that captures the essential patterns, relationships, and information present in the full dataset—these are the mesoscale weather patterns. We demonstrate our methodology by applying it to a spatio-temporal dataset of atmospheric observations, the ERA5 dataset, in Singapore. The MWPs offer valuable insights into the region’s diverse weather conditions and help researchers, climatologists, and policymakers comprehend the complex interactions between atmospheric elements. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Machine learning; Mesoscale weather patterns; Representative subset selection; Submodular functions,Adversarial machine learning; Dimensionality reduction; Information management; Urban transportation; Climate datasets; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Machine-learning; Meso scale; Mesoscale weather pattern; Representative subset selection; Submodular functions; Subset selection; Weather patterns; Decision making; data set; decision making; machine learning; mesoscale meteorology; optimization; weather forecasting; Singapore [Southeast Asia],,,,,"National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","The research was conducted under the Cooling Singapore project, funded by Singapore\u2019s National Research Foundation (NRF).","Piotrowicz, Katarzyna, A selection of weather type classification systems and examples of their application, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 140, 1-2, pp. 719-730, (2020); Krause, Andreas, Robust submodular observation selection, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 9, pp. 2761-2801, (2008); Lin, Hui, A class of submodular functions for document summarization, 1, pp. 510-520, (2011); Nevat, Ido, The Urban Heat Footprint (UHF)—a new unified climatic and statistical framework for urban warming, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 140, 1-2, pp. 359-374, (2020); Nevat, Ido, Urban Climate Risk Mitigation via Optimal Spatial Resource Allocation, Atmosphere, 13, 3, (2022); Nevat, Ido, Recommendation system for climate informed urban design under model uncertainty, Urban Climate, 31, (2020); Hersbach, Hans E., The ERA5 global reanalysis, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 146, 730, pp. 1999-2049, (2020); Era Report Series, (2009); Merra 2 File Specification, (2016); Ncep Climate Forecast System Reanalysis Cfsr 6 Hourly Products January 1979 to December 2010, (2010)","I.

While extensive research exists on rainfall magnitude forecasting, less attention has been given to predicting rainfall occurrences. This study addresses this gap by examining rainfall state prediction in four cities in India: Bhubaneshwar, Pune, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. Traditionally, the Markov Chain model has been used to simulate rainfall occurrences, but higher-order Markov models remain unexplored. Additionally, not many studies have utilized Machine Learning (ML) models for rainfall state prediction. This research compares Decision Tree-based Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) techniques with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order Markov Chains. Results indicate that Random Forest and XGBoost outperform Markov Chain models in predicting daily rainfall states. However, for rainfall statistics like wet days, dry spell duration, and rain event length, the stochastic Markov Chain model proves more effective. This study’s findings are crucial for enhancing model selection criteria, thereby improving the efficiency and applicability of rainfall occurrence models in various fields. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",Machine Learning; Markov Chain; Rainfall State Prediction; Random Forest; XGBoost,Decision trees; Prediction models; Stochastic systems; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Markov chain models; Model learning; Rainfall state prediction; Rainfall statistics; Random forests; State prediction; Tree-based ensembles; Xgboost; Markov chains; agricultural development; ensemble forecasting; forecasting method; machine learning; precipitation assessment; rainfall; urban design; water management; Bengaluru; Hyderabad [Telangana]; India; Karnataka; Maharashtra; Pune; Telangana,,,,,,,"Abbot, John W., Application of artificial neural networks to rainfall forecasting in Queensland, Australia, Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, 29, 4, pp. 717-730, (2012); Bartz-Beielstein, Thomas, Case Study II: Tuning of Gradient Boosting (xgboost), pp. 221-234, (2023); Belayneh, Anteneh, Long-term SPI drought forecasting in the Awash River Basin in Ethiopia using wavelet neural networks and wavelet support vector regression models, Journal of Hydrology, 508, pp. 418-429, (2014); Bhattacharjee, Sutapa, Hydrodynamic modelling and vulnerability analysis to assess flood risk in a dense Indian city using geospatial techniques, Natural Hazards, 105, 2, pp. 2117-2145, (2021); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Challinor, A.

It aims to spark discussion on urban flood risk and resilience rather than provide a literature review or definitive answers. Assessing urban flood risk and resilience is complex due to the spatio-temporal nature of rainfall, urban landscape features (e.g., buildings, roads, bridges and underpasses) and the interaction between aboveground and underground drainage systems. Flood simulation methods have evolved to analyse flood mitigation schemes, damage evaluation, flood risk mapping and green infrastructure impacts. Advances in terrain mapping technologies have improved flood analyses. Despite investments in flood management infrastructure, a residual flood risk remains, necessitating an understanding of the recovery and return to normality post-flood. Both risk and resilience approaches are essential for urban flood planning and management. Future challenges and opportunities include both technological and governance solutions, with artificial intelligence advancements offering the potential for digital twins to better protect urban communities and enhance the recovery from flood disasters. © 2025 by the author.",artificial intelligence; flood; infrastructure; resilience; risk; simulation; uncertainty,,,,,,,,"Teng, Jin, Flood inundation modelling: A review of methods, recent advances and uncertainty analysis, Environmental Modelling and Software, 90, pp. 201-216, (2017); Dottori, Francesco, Developments of a flood inundation model based on the cellular automata approach: Testing different methods to improve model performance, Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, 36, 7-8, pp. 266-280, (2011); Ghimire, Bidur, Formulation of a fast 2D urban pluvial flood model using a cellular automata approach, Journal of Hydroinformatics, 15, 3, pp. 676-686, (2013); Liu, Jiahong, Uncertainties of urban flood modeling: Influence of parameters for different underlying surfaces, Environmental Research, 182, (2020); Reinstaller, Stefan, Identification of High‐Impact Uncertainty Sources for Urban Flood Models in Hillside Peri‐Urban Catchments, Water (Switzerland), 14, 12, (2022); Vitousek, Sean, Doubling of coastal flooding frequency within decades due to sea-level rise, Scientific Reports, 7, 1, (2017); Rosner, Ana L., A risk-based approach to flood management decisions in a nonstationary world, Water Resources Research, 50, 3, pp. 1928-1942, (2014); Haimes, Yacov Y., Water system complexity and the misuse of modeling and optimization, pp. 1-10, (2000); Simonović, Slobodan P., Resilience to climate change-caused flooding—Metro Vancouver case study, River, 1, 1, pp. 47-59, (2022); McClymont, Kerri, Flood resilience: a systematic review, Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 63, 7, pp. 1151-1176, (2020)",,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,,,23065338,,,,English,Hydrology,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003816686

This study aims to use advanced deep learning technology and generative adversarial networks to construct an efficient urban and rural landscape feature recognition model to achieve accurate analysis and classification of urban and rural landscape elements. This paper first introduces the basic principles of deep learning and generative adversarial networks and their application status in the field of urban and rural landscape feature processing and then elaborates on how to combine these two technologies to design a new urban and rural landscape feature recognition framework. The model is trained by a large number of multi-source data sets such as high-resolution satellite images and aerial photos, and successfully extracts key elements such as architectural style, green coverage, road layout, etc., and can accurately transform this information into intuitive visual expression, providing a scientific basis for subsequent urban planning. Experiments show that after training with 50,000 images, the proposed model has achieved satisfactory results: the accuracy rate of urban and rural landscape feature recognition reaches 93.2%, which is better than the current mainstream algorithms. This achievement not only helps to deepen our understanding of the spatial pattern of urban and rural areas but may also be widely used in cultural heritage protection, ecological environment monitoring, tourism development and other fields, which have important theoretical value and social significance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",Applied research; Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Model construction; Urban and rural landscape feature recognition,Adversarial networks; Applied research; Deep learning; Features recognition; Landscape feature; Model construction; Rural landscapes; Urban and rural; Urban and rural landscape feature recognition; Urban landscape; Generative adversarial networks; algorithm; cultural heritage; landscape ecology; rural area; rural landscape; satellite imagery; tourism development,,,,,,,"Allawi, Ahmed Hussein, A new approach towards the sustainability of urban-rural integration: The development strategy for central villages in the Abbasiya District of Iraq using GIS techniques, Regional Sustainability, 4, 1, pp. 28-43, (2023); Anríquez, G., Refining the scale of the rural-urban landscape: A policy-relevant application to Chile, Applied Geography, 168, (2024); Bobadilla, Jesús Bobadilla@upm Es, Wasserstein GAN-based architecture to generate collaborative filtering synthetic datasets, Applied Intelligence, 54, 3, pp. 2472-2490, (2024); Chandra, Rohitash, Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Multi-Step Ahead Time Series Prediction, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 83105-83123, (2021); Chew, Alvin Wei Ze, Large-scale 3D point-cloud semantic segmentation of urban and rural scenes using data volume decomposition coupled with pipeline parallelism, Automation in Construction, 133, (2022); Dietz, Katharina, Want More WANs?

However, there is an imbalance between the street environment and urban amenities. It is necessary to explore the current status and propose optimization strategies to promote the coordinated development of urban spaces. Dalian, China, was selected as the study area. Based on space syntax, high-accessibility and low-accessibility streets were selected as study sites. An evaluation system was constructed as part of the study. It included the urban function and perceived street quality. Data on the density and diversity of urban amenities were obtained by establishing points of interest (POIs). The subjective and psychological perception of quality was calculated using street view images (SVIs). Then, a coupling analysis based on the urban function and perceived quality was conducted as part of the study. The results indicated that there were differences in the development levels of urban amenities and in regard to spatial quality in Dalian. Specifically, high-accessibility streets and urban amenities were mainly concentrated in the central urban area. The perceived quality of high-accessibility streets was higher than low-accessibility streets. The coupling analysis found that high-accessibility and low-accessibility streets had the highest proportions of advantage streets and opportunity streets. The urban amenities and subjective perception of quality were the highest in regard to advantage streets. The perception of beauty was the lowest in regard to maintenance streets. The psychological perception was the highest among improvement streets. Openness was the highest in regard to opportunity streets. As a result of the coupling analysis, this study not only helps to optimize the layout of urban amenities and improve the quality of the street environment, but also provides practical guidance for future urban design. Additionally, the results of this study will help to promote the coordinated development of street environments and urban amenities and enhance the overall livability and spatial quality of the urban environment. © 2025 by the authors.",accessibility; deep learning; multi-source data; perceived quality; urban function,Deep learning; Accessibility; Coupling analysis; Multi-source data; Multi-Sources; Perceived quality; Perceptions of qualities; Source data; Spatial quality; Urban function; Data quality,,,,,"Department of Education of Liaoning Province, (JYTMS20231583)","This research was funded by a Project of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education, grant numbers, JYTMS20231583.","Cities for People, (2010); Cai, Zipan, Urban spatial dynamic modeling based on urban amenity data to inform smart city planning, Anthropocene, 42, (2023); Smith, Barton A., Measuring the value of urban amenities, Journal of Urban Economics, 5, 3, pp. 370-387, (1978); Larsson, Anders, Exploring the potential for sustainable accessibility across settlement types.

This study identifies the main factors affecting transparency (SD) in these water bodies and proposes targeted management strategies. Machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), were applied to analyze SD drivers under various water supply conditions. Results show that, for surface water-supplied lakes, the GBDT model was most effective, identifying chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), inorganic suspended solids (ISS), and hydraulic retention time (HRT) as primary factors. For tap water-supplied lakes, ISS and dissolved oxygen (DO) were critical while, for rainwater retention bodies, the XGBoost model highlighted chemical oxygen demand (COD<inf>Mn</inf>) and HRT as key factors. Further analysis with ANN models provided optimal learning rates and hidden layer configurations, enhancing SD predictions through contour mapping. The findings indicate that, under low suspended solid conditions, the interaction between HRT and ISS notably affects SD in surface water-supplied lakes. For tap water-supplied lakes, SD is predominantly influenced by ISS at low levels, while HRT gains significance as concentrations increase. In rainwater retention lakes, COD<inf>Mn</inf> emerges as the primary factor under low concentrations, with HRT interactions becoming prominent as COD<inf>Mn</inf> rises. This study offers a scientific foundation for effective strategies in ULL water quality management and aesthetic enhancement. © 2025 by the authors.",importance analysis; machine learning; urban landscape lakes; water quality management; water-scarce city,chlorophyll a; landscape; machine learning; model validation; rainwater; water management; water quality; water supply; China; Shanxi; Taiyuan,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFC0408602); (202103021224107); (202304041101047)","This work was financially supported by National Key Research and Development Program Project (No. 2019YFC0408602), Fundamental Research Program of Shanxi Province (No. 202103021224107), and Shanxi Province science and technology cooperation and exchange special project (No. 202304041101047).","United Nations World Water Development Report 2022 Groundwater Making the Invisible Visible, (2022); Macias-Fauria, Marc, Pleistocene Arctic megafaunal ecological engineering as a natural climate solution?, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 375, 1794, (2020); Ek, Kristina, Priorities and Preferences in Water Quality Management - a Case Study of the Alsterån River Basin, Water Resources Management, 34, 1, pp. 155-173, (2020); Chang, Nini, A novel index for assessing the water quality of urban landscape lakes based on water transparency, Science of the Total Environment, 735, (2020); Reclaimed Water Reuse for Replenishing Urban Waters in Water Dificient Cities Theories and Technologies for Landscape Water Quality Control, (2018); Wu, Qiong, Impacts of meteorological variations on urban lake water quality: A sensitivity analysis for 12 urban lakes with different trophic states, Aquatic Sciences, 76, 3, pp. 339-351, (2014); Liu, Jia, Pre-classification improves relationships between water clarity, light attenuation, and suspended particulates in turbid inland waters, Hydrobiologia, 711, 1, pp. 71-86, (2013); Lee, Lee Hsueh, The impact of water quality on the visual and olfactory satisfaction of tourists, Ocean and Coastal Management, 105, pp. 92-99, (2015); Chang, Nini, Current status and characteristics of urban landscape lakes in China, Science of the Total Environment, 712, (2020); J Water Resour Prot, (2016)","J.

Traditionally, DSMs are generated by rasterizing Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. While LiDAR provides high-resolution details, the acquisition of required data is logistically challenging and costly, leading to limited spatial coverage and temporal frequency. Satellite imagery, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), contains information on surface height variations in the scene within the reflected signal. Transforming satellite imagery data into a global DSM is challenging but would be of great value if those challenges were overcome. This study explores the application of a U-Net architecture to generate DSMs by coupling Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery. The model is trained on surface height data from multiple U.S. cities to produce a normalized DSM (NDSM) and assess its ability to generalize inferences for cities outside the training dataset. The analysis of the results shows that the model performs moderately well when inferring test cities but its performance remains well below that of the training cities. Further examination, through the comparison of height distributions and cross-sectional analysis, reveals that estimation bias is influenced by the input image resolution and the presence of geometric distortion within the SAR image. These findings highlight the need for refinement in preprocessing techniques as well as advanced training approaches and model architecture that can better handle the complexities of urban landscapes encoded in satellite imagery. © 2025 by the authors.",convolutional neural network; deep learning; multispectral; normalized digital surface model; Synthetic Aperture Radar; urban,Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Image analysis; Image resolution; Radar imaging; Time difference of arrival; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Digital surface models; Height distribution; Light detection and ranging; Multi-spectral; Normalized digital surface model; Space-borne; Surface height; Urban; Satellite imagery,,,,,,,"Braun, Andreas, Retrieval of digital elevation models from Sentinel-1 radar data - Open applications, techniques, and limitations, Open Geosciences, 13, 1, pp. 532-569, (2021); Radar Remote Sensing of Urban Areas, (2010); Thiele, Antje, Extraction of builidng shape from TanDEM-X data, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 40, 1W1, pp. 345-350, (2013); Koppel, Kalev, Sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter to characteristics of buildings, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 38, 22, pp. 6298-6318, (2017); Rodríguez, Ernesto, A global assessment of the SRTM performance, Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 72, 3, pp. 249-260, (2006); Misra, Prakhar, Comparison of digital building height models extracted from AW3D, TanDEM-X, ASTER, and SRTM digital surface models over Yangon City, Remote Sensing, 10, 12, (2018); Uuemaa, Evelyn, Vertical accuracy of freely available global digital elevation models (Aster, aw3d30, merit, tandem-x, srtm, and nasadem), Remote Sensing, 12, 21, pp. 1-23, (2020); Copernicus Dems Quality Assessment Summary, (2021); Copernicus Dem Global and European Digital Elevation Model Cop Dem, (2022); Rossi, Cristian, Urban DEM generation, analysis and enhancements using TanDEM-X, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 85, pp. 120-131, (2013)","V.

By applying advanced boosting algorithms—specifically, XGBoost, GradientBoost, and CatBoost—along with hyperparameter optimization through the Fick’s law algorithm (FLA), this research introduces an innovative methodology aimed at improving the reliability and accuracy of flood hazard assessments in Ankara’s urban landscape. The analysis utilizes an extensive dataset that integrates topographic, meteorological, hydrological, and anthropogenic variables to provide critical insights into the dynamics of urban flooding with a focus on Ankara’s vulnerability. This approach is novel in that it incorporates FLA for hyperparameter optimization, marking a significant advancement in flood hazard modeling and achieving higher model accuracy and generalizability. Notably, among the various determinants of flood hazard identified, elevation emerges as the most influential factor affecting flood risk in Ankara. This finding underscores the complex relationship between urban geography and flood hazards, and highlights the need for targeted urban planning and infrastructure development strategies to effectively mitigate flood risk. The implications of this research extend beyond the local setting, contributing valuable insights to the global discourse on climate change adaptation and urban resilience.

The rise in demand, however, has wide-ranging consequences for the environment from which the material is extracted. Nevertheless, our knowledge of where the material is extracted from remains insufficient, which hinders assessments of the overall sustainability of extraction. Here, we provide a nationwide distribution of sand extraction in Rwanda by applying deep learning on highly refined resolution aerial imagery. We show that mining sites increased by 18% to 3,751 between 2008 and 2023, which are spatially linked to river valleys and urban development at the sub-watershed level. We further reveal that the expansion of sand extraction over the past decade often encroached into agricultural areas. Our approach offers a scalable way to monitor sand extraction activities to assess their implications on the natural and built environment. © 2025",deep learning; highly refined resolution satellite imagery; mining; natural resources; resource extraction; sand extraction,aerial survey; aggregate; demand analysis; economic growth; environmental impact; extraction method; hydrology; image resolution; land use change; living standard; machine learning; mining; natural resource; sand and gravel; satellite imagery; sustainability; watershed; Rwanda,,,,,"Villum Fonden, (40634, 34306); Villum Fonden; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (2022-00328, 2022-00146); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; (9064–00049B)","We thank the four anonymous reviewers as well as the Rwanda Forest Board and Remote sensing Institute of Chinese Academic of Science for providing commercial aerial and satellite imagery.

R., India Meteorological Department, New Delhi, India","In recent times, accurate forecasting of meteorological parameters, such as maximum and minimum temperature at a location, has gained significant research importance due to its crucial role in effective and impact-based forecasting for heat waves and cold waves. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to capture the complex interactions and nonlinear patterns inherent in urban temperature dynamics. Ensemble machine learning techniques have gained prominence in weather forecasting due to their ability to combine multiple models and improve forecast accuracy. By leveraging diverse algorithms and data sources, ensemble methods enhance the robustness and reliability of weather forecasts, enabling more precise and skillful predictions of atmospheric conditions. This study explores the performance of an ensemble machine learning technique-based random forest regression (RFR) model for forecasting maximum and minimum temperatures for four major cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Ranchi. Daily data spanning over 23 years (2000–2022) is extracted from the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) gridded data for four cities. Variables like rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature and their climatology, along with their derived parameters are selected for analysis. Based on the correlation coefficient matrix, dependent variables are identified. To evaluate the performance of the RFR model, various evaluation metrics such as R2 score, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, variance in residual, and probability of detection were employed. The findings illustrate that the selected model proves to be a reliable temperature forecasting tool, exhibiting a one-day forecast detection capability of up to 86–98% across selected cities in India, thereby offering spatial coverage across the Indian urban landscape. The results also depict the effect of variable selection for the model, showing the error incurring is high even though the final model accuracy is high. Results obtained from this study encourage us to explore other variables that affect the model forecast for spatial location. Also, this study aims to improve the understanding of temperature variations in major Indian cities and provide valuable insights for climate resilience planning. © Indian Academy of Sciences 2025.",evaluation metrics; machine learning; random forest regression; Temperature forecast,climate conditions; cold wave; heat wave; machine learning; temperature effect; weather forecasting; Chennai; Delhi; India; Jharkhand; Maharashtra; Mumbai; Ranchi; Tamil Nadu,,,,,"Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services, INCOIS; Indian Institute of Technology Madras, IITM; India Meteorological Department, IMD","The authors are highly grateful to the India Meteorological Department for providing the climate data through the collaborative efforts of IITM, NCMRWF, INCOIS and NCEP institutes of the MoES.

While CFD simulations are effective for wind studies, such as analyzing wind loads, pedestrian comfort, and pollution dispersion, they require significant computational resources and time. Recently, Machine Learning has demonstrated strong potential in providing accurate and immediate predictions by learning from datasets. By training on CFD-generated data, the ML model can quickly produce accurate and physically consistent results, addressing the limitations of CFD methods. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence model was chosen for CFD simulations, which were validated against experimental data, with mesh sensitivity analyzed at a wind speed of 3 m/s. A dataset of 300 cases, involving 100 hypothetical buildings and three wind speeds (3, 4, and 5 m/s), was generated to train the ML model. A multi-output regression model was proposed to effectively predict key parameters—wind velocity, turbulence intensity, and CO₂ mass fraction—in the selected urban domain. The Random Forest algorithm, which best represented the CFD results, was selected for model development. The ML model demonstrated high efficiency on new data, achieving 88-96% accuracy.

However, existing building material databases are typically limited to individual projects or specific geographic areas, offering only approximate assessments. Acquiring large-scale and precise material data is hindered by inadequate records and financial constraints. Here, we introduce a novel automated framework that harnesses recent advances in sensing technology and deep learning to identify roof and facade materials using remote sensing data and Google Street View imagery. The model was initially trained and validated on Odense's comprehensive dataset and then extended to characterize building materials across Danish urban landscapes, including Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Our approach demonstrates the model's scalability and adaptability to different geographic contexts and architectural styles, providing high-resolution insights into material distribution across diverse building types and cities. These findings are pivotal for informing sustainable urban planning, revising building codes to lower carbon emissions, and optimizing retrofitting efforts to meet contemporary standards for energy efficiency and emission reductions. © 2025",Building material intensity; Built environment; Deep learning; Remote sensing; Streetview image,,,,,,"European Commission, EC, (101056810); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202107940001, 202006730004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71991484, 71991480)","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71991484, 71991480), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Peking University, the Independent Research Fund Denmark (iBuildGreen), the European Union under grant agreement No. 101056810 (CircEUlar), and the China Scholarship Council (202006730004 and 202107940001).","Zhong, Xiaoyang, Global greenhouse gas emissions from residential and commercial building materials and mitigation strategies to 2060, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Elhacham, Emily, Global human-made mass exceeds all living biomass, Nature, 588, 7838, pp. 442-444, (2020); Berrill, Peter, Decarbonization pathways for the residential sector in the United States, Nature Climate Change, 12, 8, pp. 712-718, (2022); Buildings, (2022); Davis, Steven J., Emissions rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, Nature Climate Change, 12, 5, pp. 412-414, (2022); Kikstra, Jarmo S., Climate mitigation scenarios with persistent COVID-19-related energy demand changes, Nature Energy, 6, 12, pp. 1114-1123, (2021); Pauliuk, Stefan, Global scenarios of resource and emission savings from material efficiency in residential buildings and cars, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Zhou, Nan, Scenarios of energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction potential in the buildings sector in China to year 2050, Nature Energy, 3, 11, pp. 978-984, (2018); Yu, Yifei, A systematic literature review on Circular Economy implementation in the construction industry: a policy-making perspective, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 183, (2022); Huang, Tao, Materials demand and environmental impact of buildings construction and demolition in China based on dynamic material flow analysis, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 72, pp. 91-101, (2013)","G.

The research team developed a preliminary method for using observational analysis and real-time object detection to study pedestrian engagement with public art. A custom machine-learning script was developed in Python based on open-source YOLOv3, an algorithm first described by Redmon et al. By building on Redmon et al.’s work, we increased the reliability and validity of our own custom script, which was tested on a range of walking conditions both at our site and using stock video footage of streets in other locales. Video recordings of pedestrian movements near sculptural artwork on Tufts campus captured by a low-tech security camera were run through the algorithm to generate path diagram images of passersby the artwork, enabling the research team to select videos where pedestrian behaviors of interest occur for empirical review. Research results evidence social walking behavior (groups of two or more) and proximity to walking path (adjacent to the sidewalk) are correlated with greater pedestrian engagement with artwork (looking at the art). These interdisciplinary methods successfully selected videos where pedestrians engaged with public artwork, verifying AI technologies are a promising research tool for studying walking behavior in a more data-driven way than has been done previously.

Understanding these decisions is essential for effective urban planning. While discrete choice models have been used to predict residential locations, their limitations in handling complex datasets have hindered their accuracy. Machine learning has shown potential to outperform discrete choice methods in transportation-related decisions like travel mode. However, the traditional application of these methods to residential location choice faces challenges due to the large number of choice alternatives and the limitations of sample size and data availability. This often leads to biased predictions, favoring popular choices over less common ones. This study introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations, making machine learning more effective for residential location choice. By applying this method and different machine learning models, the study provides a detailed comparison of their performance in predicting residential choices. A comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms reveals that XGBoost and gradient boosting models significantly outperform traditional methods, achieving a 42 % accuracy rate in predicting residential location choices on the 33 % validation data of household travel survey data from MWCOG. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to optimize land use, transportation, and urban development strategies. © 2025 The Author(s)",Extra tree; Gradient boosting; Machine learning; Random forest; Residential location choice; Stacking technique; Voting technique; XGBoost,Adversarial machine learning; Random forests; Urban transportation; Extra-trees; Gradient boosting; Location choice; Machine-learning; Residential location choice; Residential locations; Stacking technique; Stackings; Voting techniques; Xgboost; Contrastive Learning,,,,,,,"Abulibdeh, Ammar O., Analysis of mode choice affects from the introduction of Doha Metro using machine learning and statistical analysis, Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives, 20, (2023); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Transit-Oriented Development in Saudi Arabia: Riyadh as a Case Study, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 23, (2022); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Towards sustainable green mobility in the future of Saudi Arabia cities: Implication for reducing carbon emissions and increasing renewable energy capacity, Heliyon, 9, 3, (2023); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Traffic congestion patterns in the urban road network: (Dammam metropolitan area), Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 14, 3, (2023); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Investigating the New Public Transportation System in Riyadh City, Journal of the Urban Planning and Development Division, ASCE, 150, 1, (2024); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Smart transportation planning and its challenges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Sustainable Futures, 8, (2024); Banyong, Chinnakrit, A machine learning comparison of transportation mode changes from high-speed railway promotion in Thailand, Results in Engineering, 24, (2024); Transportation Research Procedia, (2017); Cantarella, G.

Traditional methods for investigating the urban thermal environment and corresponding human thermal comfort level are often resource intensive, inefficient, and limited in scope. To address these challenges, we (1) introduce a new concept named thermal affordance, which formalises the integrated inherent capacity of a streetscape to influence human thermal comfort based on its visual and physical features; and (2) an efficient method to evaluate it (visual assessment of thermal affordance — VATA), which combines street view imagery (SVI), online and in-field surveys, and statistical learning algorithms. VATA extracts five categories of image features from SVI data and establishes 19 visual-perceptual indicators for streetscape visual assessment. Using a multi-task neural network and elastic net regression, we model their chained relationship to predict and comprehend thermal affordance for Singapore. VATA predictions are validated with field-investigated OTC data, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and transferable method to assess the thermal comfort potential of urban streetscape. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by generating a geospatially explicit mapping of thermal affordance, outlining a model update workflow for long-term urban-scale analysis, and implementing a two-stage prediction and inference approach (IF-VPI-VATA) to guide future streetscape improvements. This framework can inform streetscape design to support sustainable, liveable, and resilient urban environments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Heat mitigation; Human-centric geoAI; Perception; Sustainability; Urban design; Urban planning,Thermal comfort; Affordances; Heat mitigation; Human thermal comfort; Human-centric; Human-centric geoai; Sustainable urban development; Thermal; Urban design; Urban Heat Island Effects; Visual assessments; Sustainable city; artificial intelligence; mapping method; perception; satellite imagery; sustainability; temperature effect; urban design; urban planning; visual analysis; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia],,,,,"Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE; European Research Council, ERC, (2024/DOA/002, GRSUR0600042); European Research Council, ERC; National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-295-000-171-133, GRSUR0600042); National University of Singapore, NUS","Funding text 1: We gratefully acknowledge the participants of the experiment.

While recent studies have explored the phenomenon of urban sprawl, most of these studies have been limited to the mere identification of urban sprawl without offering comprehensive urban nonlinear factors for effectively curbing urban sprawl. Hence, the study seeks to identify various urban factors influencing urban sprawl and to propose targeted strategies for mitigation. The study’s timeframe encompasses the years 2010–2019 based on three cities with typical spatial structures and sprawl characteristics: Washington, DC, Chicago, and New York. In the initial phase, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the built environment and the socioeconomic factors in these cities to fully understand their spatial characteristics. Subsequently, by calculating the urban sprawl index (USI), we unveiled both consistencies and differences in sprawl patterns across these three cities. Then, with employing a random forest model, we quantitatively explored the nonlinear relationships between these factors and the USI, effectively identifying key influencing factors and proposing targeted measures. Our research results identified that the important factors influencing sprawl patterns include the socioeconomic factors such as income distribution and employment arrangements, as well as built environment factors such as road networks. These findings provide scientific support and decision-making reinforcement for urban planning and development, promoting the optimization of urban configurations, curbing the trend of urban sprawl, and advancing sustainable urban development. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Built environment; Machine learning; Socioeconomics; Sustainable urban development; Urban sprawl,Built environment; Machine-learning; Nonlinear factors; Socio-economic factor; Socio-economics; Spatial structure; Sustainable urban development; Urban construction; Urban sprawl; Washington; Sustainable city; machine learning; nonlinearity; socioeconomic status; urban design; urban development; urban sprawl; District of Columbia; United States; Washington [District of Columbia],,,,,,,"Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2012); Abdul Somed, Arimiyaw, Rethinking the implications of sprawl to building sustainable secondary cities; case of Tamale, Ghana, Local Environment, 29, 6, pp. 806-822, (2024); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Drivers of urban sprawl in Dammam metropolitan area (DMA), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A qualitative exploration, Journal of Urban Management, 13, 3, pp. 469-481, (2024); Forum Geografi, (2018); Asibey, Michael Osei, Rethinking the implications of sprawl for sustainable urban development: Insights from the Ejisu Municipality of Ghana between 2003 and 2023, Habitat International, 152, (2024); Bosch, Martí, Addressing Urban Sprawl from the Complexity Sciences, Urban Science, 3, 2, (2019); Berkeley Undergraduate Journal, (2011); Brueckner, Jan K., Urban sprawl: Diagnosis and remedies, International Regional Science Review, 23, 2, pp. 160-171, (2000); Bueno-Suárez, Carlos, Sustaining what is unsustainable: A review of urban sprawl and urban socio-environmental policies in North America and Western Europe, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 11, (2020); Journal of Agriculture Food Systems and Community Development, (2013)","X.

A hybrid approach enables stakeholders to actively define their city’s future by simulating several re-design scenarios utilizing AI data management. This interactive representation of possible results enables well-informed decision-making, where the advantages and limitations are carefully considered, guaranteeing that the re-design aligns with the requirements and needs of the local communities. This integrative method promotes openness and a feeling of responsibility, establishing the basis for resilient urban environments that emerge from conflict. METHODS: The study establishes a foundation for using Artificial Intelligence technologies to solve complex urban development challenges by critically examining existing approaches for urban re-design after the war and promoting interventions powered by Artificial Intelligence-driven processes. This study aims to contribute to the field of post-war rebuilding of urban landscapes by developing a solution that can be generalized. This study adopts a qualitative methodology approach to investigate the possible integration of Artificial Intelligence in re-designing urban landscapes post-war. The methodology is structured to examine existing approaches and studies of post-war urban recovery, compare traditional and AI-assisted approaches, and propose a hybrid approach that combines both. The study structure is a literature review and theoretical approach development, data collection, and analysis, depending on multiple sources, including government reports and academic research, as well as hybrid approach development. FINDINGS: The discussion provides theoretical evidence of the potential advances in this empirical approach, highlighting the efficiency improvements achievable by using Artificial Intelligence technologies in a hybrid phased approach that integrates traditional post-war processes with Artificial Intelligence-assisted ones. The study also highlights the importance of ethical considerations in Artificial Intelligence restoration procedures, addressing acceptance, community involvement, and cultural heritage safeguarding concerns. This emphasis on ethics reassures the audience about Artificial Intelligence’s responsible and conscientious use in post-war re-design. CONCLUSION: The study explores the potential integration of Artificial Intelligence in re-designing postwar urban landscapes. It compares conventional methods of urban revival with innovative Artificial Intelligence-supported methods to determine the advantages of utilizing Artificial Intelligence in post-war urban re-design. Traditional techniques for gathering data, allocating resources, and engaging the community have many challenges that negatively affect the effectiveness of re-designing and re-design measures. This study suggests that integrating Artificial Intelligence with traditional strategies can help overcome these challenges by analyzing extensive datasets, which leads to effective decision-making. A hybrid approach combining conventional and Artificial Intelligence-supported methods is suggested to improve the resiliency and sustainability of the re-designing process. It aims to enhance resource distribution and strategic planning through Artificial Intelligence-assisted strategies. ©2025 The author(s).",AI-assisted design approach; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Conventional design approach; Data management; Post-war redesign,,,,,,,"This study was done while the authors were faculty members.

Traditionally, assessments for urban greening levels using Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from satellite remote sensing images, often overlooking street greening from a human-scale perspective. This study combined spatial syntax, machine learning techniques, streetscape images, and remote sensing data to comprehensively assess thoroughly analyse street greening levels in Chengdu’s Fourth Ring Road. Additionally, by integrating accessibility analysis with Green View Index (GVI), this study identified areas that should be prioritised for street greening interventions. The results indicate that: (1) Streets in the western and southern regions of Chengdu City’s Fourth Ring Road possessed higher GVI. (2) There is a significant difference in the overall distributions of GVI and NDVI, particularly in the central and eastern regions. (3) Streets with “high commuting and walking accessibility (low GVI) overlapped in the area east of Shuncheng Avenue.

This public infrastructure is deficient and lacks adequate equipment for the people who use, occupy, and transit within and around it, as well as for the numerous activities that occur, particularly at Carapungo’s Entry Park. Traditional methods for analyzing urban dynamics and land use are typically rigid and fail to grasp the complex and nonlinear nature of public spaces, especially in informal Global South cities. However, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, combined with aerial drone videos, have enabled the modeling and prediction of urban dynamics beyond state regulations and formal planning. In this context, we developed a model using Computer Vision Technology and the YOLOv5 algorithm, incorporating Deep Learning training. The objective is twofold: firstly, to detect people, their movement and speed; and secondly, to produce “Occupancy” and “Count & Speed” cartographies that highlight commuters’ spatial patterns. These situated cartographies provide valuable insights into urban design, mobility, and interaction within a conflicted public space’s-built environment. The generated data offer planners and policymakers quantitative spatial information to consider local practices and dynamics in urban planning, particularly in situations of informality and insufficient urban infrastructure. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial intelligence; image detection; public space; unmanned aerial vehicles; urban occupation; YOLOv5,aerial photograph; artificial intelligence; cartography; commuting; detection method; image analysis; prediction; public space; spatial analysis; state role; unmanned vehicle; urban planning; Ecuador; Pichincha; Quito,,,,,"Universidad de Las Américas Ecuador, UDLA, (ARQ.AMG.20.02); Universidad de Las Américas Ecuador, UDLA","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Universidad de Las Americas, Quito, Ecuador; ARQ.AMG.20.02.","Alahi, Alexandre, Robust real-time pedestrians detection in urban environments with low-resolution cameras, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 39, pp. 113-128, (2014); Alavi, Hamed Seiied, Introduction to human-building interaction (HBI): Interfacing HCI with architecture and urban design, ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 26, 2, (2019); Handbook of Computational Geometry, (2000); Badrinarayanan, Vijay, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); Bramich, Daniel M., A new algorithm for difference image analysis, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters, 386, 1, pp. L77-L81, (2008); Butilǎ, Eugen Valentin, Urban Traffic Monitoring and Analysis Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): A Systematic Literature Review, Remote Sensing, 14, 3, (2022); Craye, Céline, Spatio-temporal semantic segmentation for drone detection, (2019); Direccion Metropolitana De Politicas Y Planeamiento De La Movilidadpub L no EC Epm Metro Quito 208964, (2021); Geyer, Christopher, Active target search from UAVs in urban environments, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2366-2371, (2008); Gouiaa, Rafik, Advances in convolution neural networks based crowd counting and density estimation, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 5, 4, (2021)","A.

Several studies have confirmed that campus public spaces contain multiple restorative potentials. Yet, the campus public space is still not ready to meet students’ new need for restorative percetions. Renewal practices for campus public spaces that integrate multi-issues are becoming more important, and further clarification of the measurement methods and optimization pathways is also needed. This study applied the semantic segmentation technique of the deep learning model to extract the feature indicators of outdoor public space based on street view image (SVI) data. The subjective evaluation of small-scale SVIs was obtained using the perceived restorative scale-11 (PRS-11) questionnaire. On this basis, restorative benefit evaluation models were established, including the explanatory and predictive models. The explanatory model used Pearson’s correlation and multiple linear regression analysis to identify the key indicators affecting restorative benefits, and the predictive model used the XGBoost 1.7.3 algorithm to predict the restorative benefit scores on the campus scale. The accessibility results from sDNA were then overlayed to form a comprehensive assessment matrix of restoration benefits and accessibility dimensions to identify further “areas with optimization potential”. In this way, three types of spatial dimensions (LRB-HA, HRB-LA, and LRB-LA) and sequential orders of temporal dimensions (short-term, medium-term, and long-term) were combined to propose optimization pathways for campus public space with the dual control of restorative benefits and accessibility. This study provides methodological guidelines and empirical data for campus regeneration and promotes outdoor public space efficiency. In addition, it can offer positive references for neighborhood-scale urban design and sustainable development. © 2025 by the authors.",accessibility; deep learning; restorative benefits; sDNA; street view images; university campus outdoor public spaces,accessibility; DNA; environmental restoration; GIS; machine learning; public space; satellite imagery; software; university sector,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52078113); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52078113).,"Wang, Jianguo, The digital presentation of human-oriented urban design, Sustainable Cities and Society, 97, (2023); Future of Cities Universities and Cities, (2015); Restorative Campus Landscapes Fostering Education Through Restoration, (2013); Ibrahim, Ahmed K., A systematic review of studies of depression prevalence in university students, Journal of Psychiatric Research, 47, 3, pp. 391-400, (2013); World Mental Health Report Transforming Mental Health for all; 2022 National Depression Blue Book; Hodson, Cody B., Green urban landscapes and school-level academic performance, Landscape and Urban Planning, 160, pp. 16-27, (2017); Kearns, Robin A., Placing therapeutic landscape as theoretical development in Health & Place, Health and Place, 61, (2020); Ning, Wei, Effects of brief exposure to campus environment on students' physiological and psychological health, Frontiers in Public Health, 11, (2023); Aghabozorgi, Koorosh, How university blue and green space affect students’ mental health: A scoping review, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 97, (2024)","J.

To address this research gap, the study employs several widely used image classification method classified into three categories to evaluate their segmentation capabilities for extracting UF across eight cities. The results indicate that pixel-based methods only excel in clear urban environments, and their overall accuracy is not consistently high. RF and SVM perform well but lack stability in object-based UF extraction, influenced by feature selection and classifier performance. Deep learning enhances feature extraction but requires powerful computing and faces challenges with complex urban layouts. SAM excels in medium-sized urban areas but falters in intricate layouts. Integrating traditional and deep learning methods optimizes UF extraction, balancing accuracy and processing efficiency.

It analyzes data to identify patterns, creates tailored designs, enhances creativity, and allows designers to explore complex possibilities for diverse industries. This study uses a Gen-AI design generation process to develop an urban landscape fumigation service robot. This study proposes a machine-learned multimodal and feedback-based variational autoencoder (MMF-VAE) model that incorporates a readily available spraying robot dataset and includes design considerations from various research efforts to ensure real-time deployability. The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven and feedback-based approaches in generating design specifications for a fumigation robot with the targeted requirements of autonomous navigation, precision spraying, and an extended runtime. The design generation process comprises three stages: (1) parameter fixation, emphasizing functionality-based and aesthetic-based specifications; (2) design specification generation using the proposed MMF-VAE model with and without a spraying robot dataset; and (3) robot development based on the generated specifications. A comparative analysis evaluated the impact of the dataset-driven design generation. The design generated with the dataset proved more feasible and optimized for real-world deployment with the integration of multimodal inputs and iterative feedback refinement. A real-time prototype was then constructed using the model’s parametric constraints and tested in actual fumigation scenarios to validate operational viability.

The machine learning approaches are trained and validated using remote sensing data from 2014, 2019, and 2024. Various explanatory variables representing topographical and spatial characteristics, as well as urban landscapes, are used. Experimental results show that LightGBM outperforms other benchmark methods. In addition, Shapley Additive Explanations are utilized to clarify the impact of the factors affecting LST. The analysis outcomes indicate that while the importance of these variables changes over time, urban density and greenspace density consistently emerge as the most influential factors.

Despite numerous studies investigating its causes, spatial distribution, and impacts, there is a scarcity of research focused on predicting its occurrence. This study addresses this gap by developing a machine learning model to identify areas susceptible to illegal land invasion within the Cape Town Metropole. A random forest (RF) regression model was built utilizing samples of prevalence and pseudoabsence. A total of 1070 samples were collected (535 points per class), with 70% used for training and 30% used for validation. The RF model demonstrated accurate predictive performance with an R2 of 0.809. The study's findings indicate that areas bordering existing informal settlements are most at risk of future illegal land occupation. The developed RF model can be a valuable tool for urban planners and policymakers in developing more effective strategies to prevent and manage illegal land occupation. © 2025 The Author(s).

However, there is a lack of understanding of how park settings influence usage patterns by socio-demographic characteristics. This study seeks to address this gap by exploring the association between park characteristics and gendered usage patterns across different times of the day. We employed big data analytics and computer vision techniques to analyze human behavior in two urban parks. These parks have comparable environments characterized by shared features, including paths, playgrounds, seating, lawns, greenery, and amenities. One is designed as a linear park, while the other is trapezoid-shaped. The distribution of facilities varies within the parks’ spaces. The key innovation of this approach lies in the use of computer vision for spatial analysis based on user-specific characteristics, particularly gender. City surveillance cameras are leveraged to gather extensive data on park usage. A comparative evaluation of the two urban parks includes a detailed examination of temporal and spatial usage patterns, offering new insights into the dynamics of urban park utilization. Findings reveal specific park features, such as playgrounds and paths, showed varying levels of utilization by different genders, highlighting the importance of tailored urban design. Males favored open lawns with dog facilities, whereas females preferred areas near playgrounds. The application of smart city technologies, such as city cameras, sets the stage for future directions in urban planning and design, highlighting opportunities to integrate advanced analytics into planning practices. © 2025 by the authors.",big data; city cameras; deep learning; gender; spatial–temporal patterns; urban park usage,computer vision; greenspace; human behavior; innovation; smart city; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; urban planning,,,,,,,"Smart Cities and Innovative Urban Technologies, (2020); Giffinger, Rudolf, Smart City: The Importance of Innovation and Planning, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1217, pp. 28-39, (2021); Karvonen, Andrew, Urban planning and the smart city: Projects, practices and politics, Urban Planning, 5, 1, pp. 65-68, (2020); Yigitcanlar, Tan, Smart cities: an effective urban development and management model?, Australian Planner, 52, 1, pp. 27-34, (2015); Huang, Haosheng, Analytics of location-based big data for smart cities: Opportunities, challenges, and future directions, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 90, (2021); Huai, Songyao, Which environmental features contribute to positive and negative perceptions of urban parks?

This shift prioritizes standardized functionality and energy efficiency over cultural identity, erasing regional architectural distinctiveness. In historical urban centers, globalization-driven interventions—such as ventilated facades or external thermal insulation systems (ETISs)—often simplify original compositions and alter building materiality, texture, and color. The Ensanche of San Sebastián serves as a case study highlighting this issue. Despite its architectural richness, which includes neoclassical and modernist buildings primarily constructed with sandstone from the Igeldo quarry, unprotected buildings are at risk of unsympathetic renovations. Such changes can distort the identity of what is considered “everyday heritage”, encompassing the residential buildings and public spaces that shape the collective memory of cities. This study presents a replicable methodology for assessing the vulnerability of buildings to facade interventions. By utilizing tools like digital twins, point cloud modeling, and typological analysis, the research establishes criteria for interventions aimed at preserving architectural values. It emphasizes the importance of collaborative efforts with urban planning authorities and public awareness campaigns to safeguard heritage. Ultimately, protecting architectural identity requires balancing the goals of energy efficiency with cultural preservation. This approach ensures that urban landscapes maintain their historical and social significance amidst globalization pressures. © 2025 by the authors.",AI; artificial intelligence; everyday heritage; facade simulation; loss of identity; vulnerability assessment,Facades; Green buildings; Historic preservation; Homogenization method; Thermal insulation; Urban growth; Complex geometric shapes; Cultural identity; Energy; Everyday heritage; Facade simulation; Globalisation; Loss of identity; Sebastian; Urban centers; Vulnerability assessments; Energy efficiency,,,,,(TR42004); (TR42367),This research has been made possible through funding from the KSIgune cluster for Cultural and Creative Industries (TR42004) and the San Sebasti\u00E1n City Council (TR42367).,"Sassen, Saskia, The global city: New York, London, Tokyo, pp. 1-397, (2013); Global Modernities, (1995); Kashf J Multidiscip Res, (2024); S M L Xl, (1995); Estoa Rev Fac De Arquit Urban Univ Cuenca, (2018); Identidades Asesinas, (1999); El Alegato Del Patrimonio, (1999); Luis Barragan La Busqueda De La Arquitectura Emocional, (2023); Int J Cult Herit Stud, (2020); Rev De Arquit Y Urban, (2022)","M.

The water distribution network (WDN) is one of the most important urban infrastructures in which optimal design and operation of it is essential during the operation period. For this purpose, in this research, artificial intelligence and data mining methods, including genetic programming (GP), gene expression programming (GEP), artificial neural network (ANN), and discrete wavelet transform function, are used to predict the daily drinking water consumption values of WDN. For this purpose, a dataset of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and daily water value of Najaf-Abad city in Iran is used during year 2014 to 2019. Here, hybrid models named W-GEP, W-GP, W-ANN, are proposed by equipping GEP, GP, and ANN with a wavelet transform function. In addition, two formulations are proposed for each model. Performance of proposed methods is investigated by determining R2, RMSE, and NSE statistical indices. For the training data of the W-GP model, the RMSE, NSE, and R2 values are 2810.46 (m3/day), 0.85, and 0.85, respectively, while for test and validation data these values are 2638.92 (m3/day), 0.87, and 0.87, respectively. Results show the good performance of proposed methods.

The previous studies conducted on Lahore lack the application of Geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) to quantify land use and land cover, which is successfully covered in this study. This study analyzes how urban sprawl has driven LULC shifts and assesses their direct impact on Land Surface Temperature (LST) using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. Landsat imagery, processed using Google Earth Engine (GEE), was employed for LULC classification and LST calculation, ensuring high accuracy through multi-level change detection and a thorough accuracy assessment. Pearson's correlation was also calculated in this study to assess the impact of decreased green cover on LST. The findings highlight a substantial decrease in green cover, from 1,292.8 km2 in 1990 to 754 km2 in 2020, alongside a marked increase in built-up areas, expanding from 262 km2 to over 550 km2. Additionally, barren land showed significant growth, while water bodies diminished. The spatiotemporal analysis of LST indicates a considerable rise in high-temperature zones, specifically the industrial zones, with areas exceeding 40 °C expanding from 2 km2 to 1,075 km2 over the study period. A strong positive correlation between increased urbanization and rising LST, particularly in areas within a 10 to 40 km radius of the Central Business District (CBD), is evident. The overall accuracy of LULC classification surpassed 94%, with the kappa coefficient above 92%, ensuring the robustness of the results. Future research should focus on evaluating the long-term socioeconomic impacts of urban sprawl and LST increment while developing heat mitigation strategies. Recommendations include adopting sustainable urban planning practices prioritizing green infrastructure, energy-efficient building designs, and policies promoting environmental preservation. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers and underscores the urgency of balancing urban growth with strategies that mitigate thermal stress, combat climate change, and foster sustainable development in Lahore. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Lahore; Landscape; Sustainable Development; Thermal environment; Urban sprawl,Balancing; Climate change; Contamination; Energy conservation; Fog; Geological surveys; Geothermal energy; Masonry materials; Radioactive wastes; Tropics; Urban planning; Windows; Lahore; Land surface temperature; Land use and land cover; Land-use and land-cover classifications; Landscape; Rapid urbanizations; Thermal environment; Urban landscape; Urban sprawl; Urban thermal environment; Sustainable development; climate change; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; GIS; land cover; land surface; Landsat; landscape structure; planning practice; policy making; remote sensing; satellite imagery; surface temperature; sustainable development; urban area; urban planning; urban sprawl; urbanization; Article; artificial intelligence; city planning; geographic information system; high temperature; kappa statistics; landscape; overexploitation; socioeconomics; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature stress; city; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; Pakistan; procedures; temperature; Punjab [Pakistan]; Cities; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Information Systems; Sustainable Development; Temperature; Urbanization,,,,,,,"In 3rd Rasta Conference, (2023); From, (2023); Assessment of Land Use Urbanization Impacts on Surface Temperature and Hydrology, (2020); Ahmad, Faheem, Environmental sustainability: Challenges and approaches, pp. 243-270, (2021); Ahmad, Shabbir, An analysis of urban sprawl in pakistan: Consequences, challenges, and the way forward, International Journal of Agricultural Extension, 8, 3, pp. 257-278, (2020); Asian Research Journal of Mathematics, (2022); Ali, Ghaffar, Exercising multidisciplinary approach to assess interrelationship between energy use, carbon emission and land use change in a metropolitan city of Pakistan, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 16, 1, pp. 775-786, (2012); Ali, Sk Ajim, Spatial susceptibility analysis of vector-borne diseases in KMC using geospatial technique and MCDM approach, Modeling Earth Systems and Environment, 5, 3, pp. 1135-1159, (2019); Global Research Journal of Natural Science and Technology, (2023); Arshad, Salman, Quantifying the contribution of diminishing green spaces and urban sprawl to urban heat island effect in a rapidly urbanizing metropolitan city of Pakistan, Land Use Policy, 113, (2022)","M.

Existing evaluation methods, primarily relying on top-down static structured data, struggle to comprehensively capture dynamic public perceptions and evaluations of commercial BE elements. Social media big data offers a novel perspective for evaluating commercial space, providing rich time series and semantic information. However, this potential remains underutilized in current research. This study proposes a fine-grained method for Commercial Built Environment perception and Evaluation based on Social media (CBEES), integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with deep learning models to extract detailed semantic information from unstructured text, enabling a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of commercial BE. Initially, CBEES employs NLP techniques to identify BE element feature variables, utilizing a Cross-Attention Mechanism to calculate element weights. Then, CBEES applies a sentiment classification algorithm based on a fine-tuned BERT model to assess public sentiment polarity. Finally, CBEES conducts dynamic and static evaluations of commercial BE using time series analysis and Random Forest classification models. Experiments using social media text data from 12 commercial projects in Wuhan identified 48 commercial BE elements. The results revealed significant temporal differences in BE element evaluations, with notable changes in negative sentiment during the initial COVID-19 reopening phase. Static evaluations identified Food street (8.4 %), Crowd (7.9 %), and Stair/Elevator (5.6 %) as key elements influencing public perception. SHapley Additive exPlanations uncovered non-linear relationships between certain BE elements and perception evaluations. CBEES provides a novel methodological framework for fine-grained monitoring of commercial BE and responding to changes in public demands, enhancing the sustainability of urban commercial space planning, design, and operational management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Commercial space; Natural language processing; Public perception evaluation; Social media data,Built environment; Commercial space; Fine grained; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Public perception; Public perception evaluation; Social media; Social medium data; demand analysis; industrial district; industrial location; land use planning; machine learning; perception; planning process; quantitative analysis; social media; space use; sustainability; urban area; urban design; urban economy; urban planning,,,,,,,"Alrefaie, Mohamed Taher, Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear event detection and classification using ontology interrogation and social media data, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 135, (2024); Apardian, Rebekka E., The role of neighborhood characteristics for firm performance in the experience economy: A case study of production volumes in California's Brewpub industry, Journal of Urban Management, 11, 2, pp. 214-225, (2022); Aprigliano, Vicente, Effects of the built environment and sociodemographic factors on accessibility in the city of Valparaíso, Chile, Journal of Transport Geography, 118, (2024); Ashayeri, Mehdi, Unraveling energy justice in NYC urban buildings through social media sentiment analysis and transformer deep learning, Energy and Buildings, 306, (2024); Balasubramanian, Sanjana, Aesthetics of urban commercial streets from the perspective of cognitive memory and user behavior in urban environments, Frontiers of Architectural Research, 11, 5, pp. 949-962, (2022); Castanha, Jick, A Systematic Literature Review on Natural Language Processing (NLP), (2022); Chang, Hanbit, Places “for the gram”: Millennials, specialty coffee bars and the gentrification of commercial streets in Seoul, Geoforum, 139, (2023); Chen, Yiqiao, The road to recovery: Sensing public opinion towards reopening measures with social media data in post-lockdown cities, Cities, 132, (2023); Chen, Zhengyan, Exploring the impact of seasonal forest landscapes on tourist emotions using Machine learning, Ecological Indicators, 163, (2024); Coisnon, Thomas, Disentangling public urban green space satisfaction: Exploring individual and contextual factors across European cities, Cities, 152, (2024)","X.

We employ an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach on publicly accessible Airbnb data to identify optimal Airbnb rental features, predict price trends, and understand Airbnb's growth in Dublin. Our analysis also integrates features from three main categories: physical geography (e.g., elevation), social geography (e.g., Electoral Division), and infrastructure & economic geography based on housing/rental market theories (e.g., distance from the city centre). This integration of geographical attributes with ML algorithms provides localised insights into Airbnb pricing dynamics, addressing gaps in previous research that often overlooked the impact of geographical features on price prediction. By applying the TreeSHAP utility (tree-based attribute for SHapley Additive exPlanations), we establish the significant role of these geographical features in predicting Airbnb rental prices, thereby reinforcing theories like Alonso's Bid-Rent Theory. We further validate the robustness of our models through testing procedures. Our study offers considerable value to urban planners, policymakers, urban researchers, and market stakeholders, deepening the understanding of Airbnb's impact on urban landscapes and contributing to the broader discourse on the Sharing Economy. © 2024 The Authors",Airbnb; Dublin; Machine Learning; Sharing Economy; XAI,Circular economy; Airbnb; Dublin; Geographical features; Ireland; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Publicly accessible; Sharing economy; Urban characteristics; XAI; Adversarial machine learning,,,,,,,"Abdar, Moloud, Analysis of user preference and expectation on shared economy platform: An examination of correlation between points of interest on Airbnb, Computers in Human Behavior, 107, (2020); Adamiak, Czesław, Airbnb offer in Spain-Spatial analysis of the pattern and determinants of its distribution, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 8, 3, (2019); Alonso, William, A THEORY OF THE URBAN LAND MARKET, Papers in Regional Science, 6, 1, pp. 149-157, (1960); Bei, Gianluca, Challenges and effects of short-term rentals regulation: A counterfactual assessment of European cities, Annals of Tourism Research, 101, (2023); undefined, (2019); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Chang, Chunwei, Study of price determinants of sharing economy-based accommodation services: Evidence from airbnb.com, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 16, 4, pp. 584-601, (2021); Chang, Chihchung, LIBSVM: A Library for support vector machines, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, 3, (2011); True to the Model or True to the Data, (2020); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016)","H.

Surrogate models (SMs) offer fast approximations using machine learning but lack generalizability for changing building morphologies. This study introduces three morphology-based feature extraction methods–Zernike image moments, polar raycasting, and principal component analysis–to train a generalizable SM for predicting annual energy use intensity (EUI) of 2.5D residential buildings in Singapore. The best SM achieved a 9.2% RMSPE, with features yielding low error and avoiding overfitting. This framework enables efficient design space exploration, aiding architects and urban designers in optimizing masterplans for energy efficiency. In the final section, we demonstrate a design space exploration (DSE) framework with our generalizable SM using a novel parametric model, showcasing its speed, adaptability and convenience over conventional optimization workflows. Highlights: Novel approach explores building morphology's impact to annual EUI . Using Zernike moments, ray casting and PCA to extract features from any 2.5D buildings. 4000 tuned SMs trained from hyperparameter optimisation. Most robust SM achieved 9.2% RMSPE when tested with 800 samples. SM's generalizability is proven by applying it to a design model with previously unseen parameters. © 2025 The Author(s).

The problem gets aggravated in the urban regions located in the eco-fragile Himalayas. Srinagar being one of the largest urban hubs in the region with exceptionally high population growth rate, the complexities in monitoring land use and associated changes due to conventional methods further exacerbates these issues. Rapid and accurate mapping of land use land cover (LULC) is essentially required for effective green space management in urban landscapes. In this study an assessment of LULC using machine learning based classifiers was done. The present study assessed LULC using Sentinel-2 data through unsupervised K-means algorithm and supervised machine learning algorithms (Artificial Neural Network-ANN, Support Vector Machine- SVM, Random Forest-RF and Decision Tree-DT). Ground truth points collected through extensive field visits and high resolution Google Earth Pro were used for model generation/mapping (70%) and validation (30%). Map validation revealed that SVM (96.60%) had the highest overall accuracy followed by RF (95.86%), DT (95.33%), ANN (88.7%) and K-means (64.51%). F-Scores varied between classifiers on account of precision and recall for different classes. High values for F depicting performance of classification models were observed for all supervised classifiers except ANN which couldn’t effectively classify wastelands (F = 58.73%), SVM performed exceptionally well for agriculture and grassland (94.02%), Habitation (96.02%) and wasteland (96.42%). DT excelled in mapping vegetation (99.41%). Waterbody was classified accurately by all the classifiers (F = 100%) except ANN (99.73%). However, Snow and Agriculture Fallow were depicted well by ANN with F Score of 99.20% and 96.39% respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Himalayas; Land use land cover; Machine learning; Urban,Adaptive boosting; Adversarial machine learning; Decision trees; Random forests; Self-supervised learning; Support vector machines; Tourism industry; Urban transportation; Vegetation mapping; F-score; Himalayas; Land use/land cover; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Population growth rates; Rapid urbanizations; Remote-sensing; Urban; Urban regions; Population statistics; algorithm; grassland; land cover; land use change; machine learning; population growth; remote sensing; urbanization; wasteland,,,,,"Cradle Coast NRM, NRM; Erasmus+, (619050-EPP-1-2020-1-DE-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP); Erasmus+","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support for using the equipment purchased under the Erasmus+ funded URGENT project (619050-EPP-1-2020-1-DE-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP) running at the Division of Natural Resource Management (NRM), Faculty of Forestry, SKUAST Kashmir.

As TomoSAR reconstruction methods advance into the deep learning (DL) era, current studies have demonstrated DL's strengths in both precision and efficiency. However, for reconstructing urban areas with prominent spatial features from building structures, current studies focus on pixel-by-pixel reconstruction without leveraging the potential benefits of these features. In this context, an exploratory study to introduce spatial feature regularization in DL reconstruction is proposed for the first time, focusing on feature description, modeling, and regularization. Spatial features are analyzed and summarized by sharp edges and regular geometric shapes within the scene. To model these features, 2-D slices are used as the basic reconstruction units, and a general intraslice and interslice strategy is proposed to harness features within and between slices. Two-dimensional slices are fused into the entire 3-D scene. Two methods of fusion are designed: parallel and serial. To regularize these features, a new computational framework called light reconstruction and enhancement is designed, which includes two stages: light reconstruction with sparsity feature regularization and enhancement with spatial feature regularization. Finally, to evaluate performance, we design an extensive evaluation framework. A newly self-constructed compound urban building simulation dataset, combined with two public measured data, forms six different tests ranging from a classical close point resolution test to a diverse urban landscape challenge test. Evaluation results reveal the effectiveness of the designs and the boost provided by spatial feature regularization, resulting in higher reconstruction precision, more complete building spatial structure retrieval, and fewer outliers. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",Deep learning (DL); deep unfolding; model-driven; spatial regularization; tomographic synthetic aperture radar (TomoSAR) reconstruction,3D reconstruction; Digital elevation model; Partitions (building); Reconstruction (structural); Deep learning; Deep unfolding; Model-driven; Regularisation; Spatial features; Spatial regularizations; Tomographic synthetic aperture radars; TomoSAR reconstruction; Unfoldings; Urban areas; machine learning; pixel; spatial analysis; synthetic aperture radar; three-dimensional modeling; two-dimensional modeling; urban area,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (62471113, 62305049, 62371104); Aeronautical Science Foundation of China, (1A2024Z071080005); Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Support Program, (2024NS-FSC0479)","Funding text 1: Tianjiao Zeng is with the School of Aeronautics ans Astronautics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China.

Accurately mapping UGS is important for sustainable urban planning and management. Traditional methods of mapping such as manual mapping, aerial photography interpretation and pixel-based classification have limitations in terms of coverage, accuracy, and efficiency. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has gained prominence due to its ability to incorporate both spectral and spatial information making it particularly effective for classification of high-resolution satellite data. This paper reviews the application of OBIA on satellite images for UGS mapping, focusing on various data sources, popular segmentation methods, and classification techniques, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. Key segmentation methodologies discussed include multi-resolution segmentation and watershed segmentation. For classification, the review covers machine learning techniques such as random forests, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks, among others. Several case studies highlight the successful implementation of OBIA in diverse urban environments by demonstrating improvements in classification accuracy and detail. The review also addresses the challenges associated with OBIA, such as dealing with heterogenous urban landscapes, data sources and with OBIA methods itself. Future directions for UGS mapping include the integration of deep learning algorithms, advancements in satellite data technologies, and the development of standardized classification frameworks. By providing a detailed analysis of the current state-of-the-art in object-based UGS mapping, this review aims to guide future research and practical applications in UGS management. © 2024 The Author(s)",Classification; Object-Based Image Analysis; Satellite Imagery; Segmentation; Urban Green Structure; Urban Planning,Aerial photography; Direct air capture; Mapping; Support vector machines; Urban growth; Data-source; Green structures; Image analyze; Image-analysis; Object based; Object-based analysis; Object-based image analyze; Objects-based; Segmentation; Urban green structure; Air quality; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; greenspace; image analysis; machine learning; satellite data; satellite imagery; segmentation; urban area; urban planning; watershed,,,,,"Norges Forskningsråd, (342631/L10); Norges Forskningsråd","The authors acknowledge the Research Council of Norway for funding this review article under Contract No. 342631/L10.

Given the shifts in water supply patterns due to global climate change and ongoing urbanization, understanding and predicting how urban design affects drought is crucial for sustainable human settlements. Previous research has primarily focused on large-scale predictive modeling, making it difficult for architects and urban designers to address potential drought risks. This study addresses that issue by proposing an urban planning prediction model based on generative adversarial networks that integrates temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) maps. The model is trained on relevant datasets by using Guangzhou as a case study, including land cover, land surface temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index data. TVDI maps are generated from untrained image pairs based on urban planning parameters. Model validation, including accuracy analysis and scenario simulations, is conducted to assess the model's ability to predict urban land surface drought resulting from changes in urban planning. This approach highlights its proactive capacity to anticipate and reveal long-term or gradually unfolding drought trends, offering valid tools for urban design and planning. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN); Machine learning; Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI); Urban drought,Adversarial machine learning; Adversarial networks; Generative adversarial network; Index maps; Land surface; Machine-learning; Temperature vegetation dryness index; Temperature-vegetation dryness indices; Urban design; Urban drought; Urban environments; Generative adversarial networks; drought; machine learning; urban design; urban planning; vegetation index; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou,,,,,"City University of Hong Kong, CityU",This research was funded by the New Faculty Start-up Grant (Project No. 9610653) from the City University of Hong Kong.

In this study, we make the first attempt to employ deep learning for urban vegetation mapping of 2120 cities in China using a 30-years Landsat archive (UV-30). We present a multimodal deep learning (MDL) model to combine features from 5 categories, namely reflective bands, remote sensing indices, texture variables, topographical variables, and time labels. We normalized elevation data locally to remove the inter-city differences, while retaining topographic details. We used time labels to account for spectral variability over time and Landsat sensors. The performance of the MDL models was compared with a vanilla deep neural network, random forest, and support vector regression. Results indicated that the fusion of different categories of features improved the prediction accuracy. The MDL performed best in most validation cities, and our results were superior to the fractional maps aggregated from high-resolution datasets in homogeneous urban landscapes. We further analyzed urban vegetation dynamics across the urban core-new town-outskirt gradients of different geographical regions and city sizes. We found a gradually diminishing de-greening trend in urban China, especially in urban cores and new towns. Nevertheless, we observed a more pronounced degradation of urban vegetation in the south regions of China compared to the north, and smaller cities show no evident urban vegetation increase. The suggested framework is valuable for urban vegetation assessments and facilitates a thorough understanding and management of urban ecosystems. © 2024",Deep learning; Remote sensing; Spectral unmixing; Urban vegetation,accuracy assessment; Landsat; machine learning; reconstruction; remote sensing; satellite sensor; spectral analysis; urban ecosystem; urbanization; vegetation dynamics; vegetation mapping; China,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42171260); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; (2023B04J0301, 2023B04J0326)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers: 42171260) and Collaborative Innovation Center for Natural Resources Planning and Marine Technology of Guangzhou (No.2023B04J0301, No. 2023B04J0326)","Ahamed, Tofael, A review of remote sensing methods for biomass feedstock production, Biomass and Bioenergy, 35, 7, pp. 2455-2469, (2011); Alonzo, Michael G., Urban tree species mapping using hyperspectral and lidar data fusion, Remote Sensing of Environment, 148, pp. 70-83, (2014); Erlandsson, Rasmus, An artificial intelligence approach to remotely assess pale lichen biomass, Remote Sensing of Environment, 280, (2022); Gao, Lin, Remote sensing algorithms for estimation of fractional vegetation cover using pure vegetation index values: A review, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 159, pp. 364-377, (2020); undefined, (2017); Guo, Hongwei, Performance of deep learning in mapping water quality of Lake Simcoe with long-term Landsat archive, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 183, pp. 451-469, (2022); Han, Yuan, Inequality in urban green provision: A comparative study of large cities throughout the world, Sustainable Cities and Society, 89, (2023); Haralick, Robert Martin, Textural Features for Image Classification, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-3, 6, pp. 610-621, (1973); He, Kaiming, Delving deep into rectifiers: Surpassing human-level performance on imagenet classification, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015 International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2015, pp. 1026-1034, (2015); Urban Res Pract, (2023)","J.

Thus, quick and accurate prediction of urban villages is crucial for urban planning, management and sustainability. Recently, point-of-interest (POI) data mining has emerged as a popular topic in urban research. This study aims to propose an urban village prediction model in complex urban landscape patterns by utilizing POI data as a single data source. We firstly calculated word embeddings of POI types as the semantic features of urban villages based on Word2Vec. Afterwards, a BiLSTM-Multiscale-Attention (BMA) model is proposed to predict urban or non-urban villages based on POI word embeddings. Experimental results in several major cities of China, including Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, Wuhan, and Guangzhou indicates that the proposed model achieved an average overall accuracy of 84.06 %, outperforming several other data-driven methods. This study demonstrates that POI data can provide accurate spatial distribution information for urban villages.

A key parameter to this end is the estimation of urban surface temperatures. Traditional approaches for such estimates, that use urban micrometeorology models, are based on simulations that require heavy computations and complex inputs — including urban geometry, radiative parameters, and meteorological conditions. As a result, they cannot be applied extensively in all cities, where some of the input parameters might be missing and computational power might not be available. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach founded upon a deep learning framework, requiring markedly simplified inputs: street view imagery and meteorological conditions. We use our model to estimate building facade surface temperatures in the city of London (Ontario, Canada) and compare results both with simulated values obtained from an established simulation software TUF-3D and ground truth data collected through an onsite campaign with a FLIR thermal imager.

Analyzing a dataset encompassing 186 neighborhoods and 848 restaurants, clustering techniques highlighted clusters 2 and 3 with the highest Indian restaurant density. Subsequent heat map analysis narrowed the selection to 57 neighborhoods, emphasizing areas lacking Indian restaurants and exhibiting lower cuisine saturation. Proximity to popular locales guided the extraction of 11 prime locations meeting business criteria. Different classifiers were applied, with K-Nearest Neighbors achieving an accuracy of 0.756, Decision Tree at 0.732 and Random Forest leading with 0.805. Notably, Random Forest emerged as the most effective classifier for optimizing restaurant localization strategies.

Multisensory fusion incorporates data from diverse sensors, like radar and cameras, to refine the reliability and accuracy of detection. Further, Radar and camera data fusion refine this process by integrating the unique strength of both technologies, which leverage the radar's proficiency in adverse weather conditions and the camera's high-resolution imaging. This incorporation enhances the object detection systems, which enables them to effectively operate across the spectrum of scenarios, from autonomous vehicles navigating challenging weather to surveillance systems monitoring critical infrastructure. Deep learning (DL), a branch of machine learning (ML), empowers this system with the capability to learn complex representations and patterns directly from the data, which enables them to generalize and adapt to new situations. By integrating the advanced methodology, we can develop strong perception system capable of interpreting and detecting objects accurately in dynamic and diverse environments, from autonomous vehicles navigating urban landscapes to surveillance systems monitoring complex environments. This study designs an Intelligent Algorithm for Enhanced Object Detection Using Deep Learning Approach on the Radar and Camera Data Fusion (IAEOD-DLRCDF) technique. The presented IAEOD-DLRCDF technique uses multi-angle joint calibration where the spatial sparse alignment of the heterogeneous data of the camera and Radar is realized with image falsification disregarded. Besides, the IAEOD-DLRCDF technique applies YOLOv8 object detector for radar and camera target detection individually which are then integrated with the image plane. Moreover, the detected objects are then classified via the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model. Furthermore, the Adam optimizer is used for the optimum hyperparameter selection of the BiLSTM network which results in a better recognition rate. The performance assessment of the IAEOD-DLRCDF method is tested under benchmark dataset. The empirical analysis stated that the IAEOD-DLRCDF method gains better performance over other models. © 2024",Adam optimizer; Data fusion; Deep learning; Machine learning; Object detection; Radar; YOLOv8,Aircraft detection; Critical infrastructures; Sensor data fusion; Adam optimizer; Autonomous Vehicles; Data fusion technique; Deep learning; Intelligent Algorithms; Learning approach; Machine-learning; Objects detection; Optimizers; YOLOv8,,,,,,,"Aziz, Kheireddine, Radar-camera Fusion for Road Target Classification, IEEE National Radar Conference - Proceedings, 2020-September, (2020); Lekić, Vladimir, Automotive radar and camera fusion using Generative Adversarial Networks, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 184, pp. 1-8, (2019); Wang, Yizhou, RODNet: Radar object detection using cross-modal supervision, pp. 504-513, (2021); Sengupta, Arindam, A DNN-LSTM based Target Tracking Approach using mmWave Radar and Camera Sensor Fusion, Proceedings of the IEEE National Aerospace Electronics Conference, NAECON, 2019-July, pp. 688-693, (2019); Kang, Daejun, Camera and Radar Sensor Fusion for Robust Vehicle Localization via Vehicle Part Localization, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 75223-75236, (2020); Zhang, Renyuan, Extending reliability of mmwave radar tracking and detection via fusion with camera, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 137065-137079, (2019); Jha, Harimohan, Object Detection and Identification Using Vision and Radar Data Fusion System for Ground-Based Navigation, pp. 590-593, (2019); Proc Intell Connected Vehicles Symp, (2017); Wei, Pan, LiDAR and camera detection fusion in a real-time industrial multi-sensor collision avoidance system, Electronics (Switzerland), 7, 6, (2018); Nobis, Felix, A Deep Learning-based Radar and Camera Sensor Fusion Architecture for Object Detection, (2019)",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,15662535; 18726305,,,,English,Inf.

Traditional adult- and survey-based walkability assessments are labor-intensive and often miss transient hazards, while prior wearable-sensor methods—threshold-based acceleration, Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MaxLE, a gait-stability index quantifying the local divergence of gait dynamics), and information entropy—either lack individual sensitivity or depend on aggregated data. This study introduces a framework that converts smartphone IMU time-series into Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images for classification by a lightweight CNN. Methods: Twenty older adults completed walking trials along a 1.2 km urban route featuring common barriers (uneven sidewalks, curb drops, narrow alleys, driveway crossings). IMU data were filtered, segmented into 2-s windows, transformed into 200 × 200-pixel GAF images, and evaluated under leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results: Among three benchmarks—peak-acceleration threshold, MaxLE (82.3% accuracy, F1-score = 0.45), and multi-user entropy—the GAF-CNN achieved 90.8% accuracy, 93.0% sensitivity, and 88.1% specificity, significantly outperforming the baselines (75–85% accuracy). Spatial mapping confirmed close correspondence between detected anomalies and true barrier locations. Discussion: These findings demonstrate that image-based deep learning provides a practical and interpretable solution for real-time, personalized detection of environmental barriers, offering a scalable tool for data-driven walkability enhancement in age-friendly urban design. © © 2025 Hong and Kim.",convolutional neural network (CNN); environmental barriers; Gramian Angular Field (GAF); older adult gait analysis; wearable sensor walkability monitoring,aged; environmental planning; female; gait; human; male; middle aged; pedestrian; smartphone; walking; Aged; Environment Design; Female; Gait; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pedestrians; Smartphone; Walking,,,,,"Korea Forest Service, KFS; Korea Forestry Promotion Institute; (RS-2023-KF002500)",The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

To enable designers, urban planners, and policymakers to improve outdoor thermal comfort, there is a need for new, fast, and user-friendly tools to simulate the city environment. This systematic review, based on the PRISMA guidelines, focuses on identifying emerging methods for quickly predicting thermal comfort indices, such as UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index) and PET (Physiologically Equivalent Temperature), using Surrogate Models—mathematical models that can replace time consuming simulations. This approach aims to facilitate data-driven performance assessments and urban design improvements. The findings indicate that current research primarily focuses on two different applications of these models: OTC evaluation and OTC improvement. In the first approach, Surrogate Models are used to evaluate the thermal comfort conditions of existing environments and to study the relationships between various factors that influence thermal perception in the built environment. In the second approach, these models can assess the effectiveness of different design strategies based on comfort performance, along with single and multi-objective optimization algorithms to identify the best-performing options. In conclusion, this review discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of adopting this methodology, highlighting the opportunities it presents for accelerating time-intensive simulations and exploring design options. Despite the promising nature of this approach, only a limited number of studies have embraced it comprehensively. Therefore, this review aims to consolidate previous scientific achievements and encourage the future adoption of this methodology. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Design Exploration; Machine Learning; Optimization; Thermal Stress; Urban Design; UTCI,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Physiological models; Thermal comfort; Urban planning; Climate index; Design Exploration; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Outdoor thermal comfort; Surrogate modeling; Thermal; Universal thermal climate index; Urban design; Thermal stress,,,,,Sapienza Università di Roma,This research was developed and funded under the projects: \u201CUniversity and Urban Regeneration: Redesigning Neglected Spaces and Routes with Sapienza as a Driver (NARRATES)\u201D-RD124190A38CC990 funded by Sapienza University of Rome.,"Annual Review of Environment and Resources Overheating of Cities Magnitude Characteristics Impact Mitigation and Adaptation and Future Challenges, (2023); la Roche, Pablo M., Carbon-neutral architectural design, pp. 1-460, (2016); Liu, Zheming, A Review of Thermal Comfort Evaluation and Improvement in Urban Outdoor Spaces, Buildings, 13, 12, (2023); Heat Vulnerability Digital Mapping at Neighbourhood Level in the Compact City, (2023); Taleghani, Mohammad, Micrometeorological simulations to predict the impacts of heat mitigation strategies on pedestrian thermal comfort in a Los Angeles neighborhood, Environmental Research Letters, 11, 2, (2016); Ooka, Ryozo, Study on optimum arrangement of trees for design of pleasant outdoor environment using multi-objective genetic algorithm and coupled simulation of convection, radiation and conduction, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 96, 10-11, pp. 1733-1748, (2008); Dogan, Timur, Retooling architectural performance analysis, pp. 429-442, (2022); Cruz, Alexandre Santana, Multi-objective optimization based on surrogate models for sustainable building design: A systematic literature review, Building and Environment, 266, (2024); Dhariwal, Jay, An approach for building design optimization using design of experiments, Building Simulation, 10, 3, pp. 323-336, (2017); Westermann, Paul, Surrogate modelling for sustainable building design – A review, Energy and Buildings, 198, pp. 170-186, (2019)","E.

These models offer novel capabilities in natural language processing tasks, potentially providing advanced support across various aspects of urban planning. Despite the promises, little is known about how and to what extent LLMs have been applied in the planning literature. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. The review depicts five key domains where LLMs are being applied in urban planning: (a) planning and management; (b) public services and participation; (c) transportation and urban mobility; (d) environmental monitoring and sustainability; and (e) urban design and architecture. Additionally, the review identifies four essential characteristics that LLMs should possess to be effective in urban planning: (a) professionalism; (b) inclusivity; (c) trustworthiness; and (e) convenience. Considering the findings, a conceptual framework is developed that illustrates how these characteristics enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of LLMs in supporting urban planning tasks. This framework offers a theoretical foundation for urban planners to effectively integrate LLMs into practice and provides a roadmap for future research and technological innovations in the application of LLMs within urban environments. © 2025 The Author(s).

Aerial sensors mounted on airplanes allow for the acquisition of high-resolution data in terms of geometry (up to 5 cm with multispectral cameras) and spectral content (hundreds of narrow bands with wavelengths from visible to short-wave and thermal infrared). In urban applications, images are generally acquired during aerial surveys planned on demand by the municipalities. Satellite images, on the other hand, feature a consistent revisit time thanks to their elliptic sun-synchronous orbits. Satellite images with low spatial granularity, often acquired through international public missions (i.e., Copernicus), are publicly accessible. Within the USAGE—Urban Data Space for Green Deal—EU project [https://www.usage-project.eu/], we investigate the integration of multi-modal and multi-resolution data from aerial and satellite platforms in urban areas for environmental analyses. In this paper, the activities specifically realized in thermal analysis are discussed. Two pilot cities are considered, Graz (Austria) and Ferrara (Italy), where aerial multispectral, thermal, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data, as well as thermal satellite images, are available (Beber et al., Int. Arch. Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spatial Inf. Sci., XLVIII-1/W3-2023, 9–16, 2023). Firstly, the land surface temperatures (LST) are calculated from thermal aerial images (0.5–1 m spatial resolution), also with the support of aerial hyperspectral images (VNIR and SWIR ranges, 1 m spatial resolution) to retrieve information on the type of surface material, thus on the surface emissivity. The LST values are then compared to those retrieved using the Landsat TIRS sensor, in order to characterize the representativeness of the Landsat pixel over the urban landscape. Moreover, a deep learning algorithm to downscale a Landsat product to airborne resolution is presented. Finally, LST maps are coupled with population density to highlight areas with higher risks. The proposed methodology could be replicated also in other similar cities. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Airborne; Data-fusion; Hyperspectral; Satellite; Thermal,,,,,,"European Commission, EU; HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme, (101059950—call HORIZONCL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-17)",The work is funded by the EU project USAGE\u2014 Urban Data Space for Green Deal (https://www.usage-project.eu/) which has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon Europe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under the Grant Agreement no 101059950\u2014call HORIZONCL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-17 (IA).,"Adler, Carolina E., Conceptualizing the transfer of knowledge across cases in transdisciplinary research, Sustainability Science, 13, 1, pp. 179-190, (2018); undefined; Beber, Raniero, MULTI-MODAL GEOSPATIAL AND THEMATIC DATA TO FOSTER GREEN DEAL APPLICATIONS, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 48, 1/W3-2023, pp. 9-16, (2023); Berk, Alexander, MODTRAN® 6: A major upgrade of the MODTRAN® radiative transfer code, Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing, Evolution in Remote Sensing, 2014-June, (2014); Bitelli, Gabriele, Aerial thermography for energetic modelling of cities, Remote Sensing, 7, 2, pp. 2152-2170, (2015); Brunet, Dominique, On the mathematical properties of the structural similarity index, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 21, 4, pp. 1488-1495, (2012); Byrnes, Arthur E., Correction of thermal imagery for atmospheric effects using aircraft measurement and atmospheric modeling techniques, Applied Optics, 25, 15, pp. 2563-2570, (1986); Duguay-Tetzlaff, Anke, Meteosat land surface temperature climate data record: Achievable accuracy and potential uncertainties, Remote Sensing, 7, 10, pp. 13139-13156, (2015); Ermida, Sofia L., Google earth engine open-source code for land surface temperature estimation from the landsat series, Remote Sensing, 12, 9, (2020); Foshag, Kathrin, Viability of public spaces in cities under increasing heat: A transdisciplinary approach, Sustainable Cities and Society, 59, (2020)","R.

Accurate LST retrieval is crucial for a variety of environmental and urban studies, including urban heat island monitoring, hydrological modeling, agricultural drought detection, and climate change assessment. Thermal infrared remote sensing is the primary technique for obtaining LST information at regional to global scales. However, conventional LST retrieval models—particularly those based on single-date, single-channel thermal imagery—are limited in their capacity to characterize the spatio-temporal variability and complex nonlinear influences of terrain, land cover, and atmospheric conditions.The need for enhanced methods that integrate multi-temporal information and address these limitations is becoming increasingly critical, especially for applications in heterogeneous urban landscapes. In response, we propose a novel correction framework that combines physical modeling with data-driven learning, using a multi-temporal dynamic feature fusion strategy to significantly improve LST retrieval accuracy. This hybrid approach not only enhances retrieval performance but also provides interpretability by quantifying the contributions of individual spatio-temporal features. Methods The proposed framework consists of a three-step workflow that leverages both physical models and machine learning for LST correction. First, an initial LST field is generated using a single-channel algorithm, which incorporates MODTRAN-simulated atmospheric parameters to correct for atmospheric effects. The surface emissivity is estimated using a vegetation cover-based model, and radiative transfer equations are applied to compute baseline surface temperature maps. Second, we construct a four-dimensional feature space to represent the spatio-temporal variability of land surface thermal behavior. The temporal features include the inter-monthly temperature differential matrix, which captures abrupt thermal changes between consecutive months, and seasonal standard deviation, which quantifies temperature variability within each season. Spatial features include terrain slope extracted from a 30 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM), and a binary urban land classification mask derived from 10 m European Space Agency (ESA) land cover data. These features are spatially aligned and fused using a Gaussian-weighted kernel to generate the final feature dataset. Third, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is employed to learn a nonlinear residual correction model. XGBoost is a scalable implementation of gradient boosting that incorporates second-order optimization, tree regularization, and parallel computation. It is well-suited for high-dimensional data and provides a mechanism to quantify feature importance, offering insights into which features most influence the temperature correction process. The model is trained on over 1.2 million valid pixels using Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level-2 LST products as ground truth. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used as performance metrics, which are calculated for both the entire region and for urban/non- urban subsets. Results and Discussions The proposed framework shows substantial improvements in LST retrieval accuracy across different seasons and land types. Compared to the original single-channel method, the annual RMSE is reduced from 5.93 ℃ to 3.90 ℃ (a 34.2% improvement), and the MAE is reduced from 5.71 ℃ to 3.43 ℃ (a 39.9% improvement). In urban built-up areas, where the thermal environment is more complex, the correction achieves a 36.4% reduction in RMSE, demonstrating the framework’s ability to handle heterogeneous surface conditions effectively (Fig. 4). Seasonal breakdown shows that the most significant improvement occurs in winter, where RMSE drops from 3.69 ℃ to 1.94 ℃ (a 47.4% improvement). Feature importance analysis reveals that the winter seasonal standard deviation contributes 84.9% to the correction (Fig. 5 and Table 2), suggesting that temperature fluctuation during cold months is a strong predictor of residual error and thermal behavior. This reflects the influence of materials with high thermal inertia, such as concrete, which stores heat during the day and releases it at night, thereby amplifying seasonal dynamics in urban areas. To further evaluate model robustness, we performed an ablation experiment by removing the dynamic temporal features and retaining only static features (slope and urban land classification). The absence of temporal dynamics led to a deterioration in performance, with annual RMSE increasing by 11.3% and winter RMSE rising by 20.1% (Fig. 6). This confirms the indispensable role of temporal features in modeling the dynamic nature of LST. In addition, we conducted a comparative evaluation using two other machine learning methods: gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT) and random forest (RF). While GBRT achieved similar accuracy to XGBoost (RMSE of 3.896 ℃), its training time was significantly longer (1066.8 min vs. 7.5 min for XGBoost). RF performed worse in both accuracy and speed (Table 3). These results validate XGBoost as a highly efficient and effective solution for large-scale, multi-temporal LST retrieval tasks. Conclusions This study presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates multi-temporal thermal features with physical modeling and machine learning to enhance LST retrieval accuracy. By constructing a comprehensive spatio-temporal feature space and applying XGBoost-based residual correction, the proposed approach significantly improves retrieval performance and reduces seasonal biases. Importantly, the use of feature importance analysis offers new interpretability to the thermal infrared inversion process, allowing for better understanding and trust in the model’s predictions. The framework represents a step forward in transitioning remote sensing from empirical“ black-box”models to explainable, data-informed physical modeling. It is especially well-suited for complex urban environments and offers a scalable, transferable method for dynamic thermal environment monitoring. These findings highlight the essential role of temporal dynamics in surface temperature estimation and pave the way for future applications in climate modeling, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. © 2025, Chinese Optical Society.

However, obtaining such historical information prior to the year 2000 is challenging. Although declassified analog images from the KH‑9 HEXAGON (hereafter, KH-9)’s mapping camera system (MCS) and panoramic camera system (PCS) at meter to sub-meter resolutions during 1970s are available, the absence of camera meta parameters (e.g., focal length, extrinsics, lens distortion) and the single film-based panchromatic image format pose significant limitations. Herein, a multifaceted analytical framework is developed to reconstruct a historical fine-scale urban database from KH‑9 MCS and KH‑9 PCS images which relies on minimal technical information. For the KH‑9 MCS, a deep learning classification framework is proposed to retrieve historical urban landscape features from KH‑9 MCS imagery. Also ablation studies are proposed to examine the impacts of deep learning hyperparameters on historical urban landscape classification and to assess the efficiency of deep learning models in comparison with benchmark machine learning techniques. For the KH‑9 PCS, first a framework is developed using SuperPoint + SuperGlue (SPSG) models to create historical ground point controls (GCPs) from KH‑9 PCS for accuracy assessment purposes and estimating the exterior orientation of the stereo cameras. Structure from motion (SfM) techniques are adopted to create an ultra-fine spatial urban stereo-anaglyph image and digital surface model (DSM). Finally, ablation investigations are conducted to compare the performance of the developed techniques with benchmark approaches. Our results suggest that KH‑9 MCS and PCS images, when analyzed with appropriate methodologies, can significantly enhance the reconstruction of a historical fine-scale urban database. Moreover, both KH‑9 MCS and PCS images can contribute to revealing super-urbanization (i.e., unprecedented urban development) including super-new urban development and super-urban redevelopment as well as super-urban no-change (i.e., stable over the four decades, 1975-2023). © Deutsche Gesellschaft für Photogrammetrie, Fernerkundung und Geoinformation (DGPF) e.V. 2025.",Deep learning; Historical DSM; Historical GCPs; KH‑9 HEXAGON; Mapping camera system (MCS); Panoramic camera system (PCS); Stereo anaglyph; Super-new urban development; Super-urban no-change; Super-urban redevelopment; SuperPoint + SuperGlue,,,,,,,,"Albarakati, Hussain Mobarak, A Unified Super-Resolution Framework of Remote-Sensing Satellite Images Classification Based on Information Fusion of Novel Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architectures, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 17, pp. 14421-14436, (2024); Altmaier, Angela, Digital surface model generation from CORONA satellite images, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 56, 4, pp. 221-235, (2002); Angewandte Geographische Informationsverarbeitung Xii, (2000); Badrinarayanan, Vijay, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); Belgiu, Mariana, Comparing supervised and unsupervised multiresolution segmentation approaches for extracting buildings from very high resolution imagery, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 96, pp. 67-75, (2014); Benz, Ursula Caroline, Multi-resolution, object-oriented fuzzy analysis of remote sensing data for GIS-ready information, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 58, 3-4, pp. 239-258, (2004); Blaschke, Thomas, Object based image analysis for remote sensing, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 65, 1, pp. 2-16, (2010); Bolch, Tobias, Planimetric and volumetric glacier changes in the Khumbu Himal, Nepal, since 1962 using Corona, Landsat TM and ASTER data, Journal of Glaciology, 54, 187, pp. 592-600, (2008); Cai, Bowen, Deep learning-based building height mapping using Sentinel-1 and Sentienl-2 data, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 122, (2023); Cao, Yinxia, A deep learning method for building height estimation using high-resolution multi-view imagery over urban areas: A case study of 42 Chinese cities, Remote Sensing of Environment, 264, (2021)","A.

This study develops 1-km resolution projections of land surface temperature (LST) using a machine learning-based downscaling approach that integrates CMIP6 global climate model (GCM) simulations with urbanisation projections under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). A random forest (RF) model was trained on 1-km resolution MODIS LST data and urbanisation ratio datasets to estimate GCM-simulated Earth skin temperature (T<inf>s</inf>) biases. The trained model was then applied to future urbanisation scenarios to project LST anomalies from 2030 to 2090. The analysis revealed a strong positive correlation of 0.785 between the urbanisation ratio and LST anomalies. The RF model accurately predicted LST anomalies with a root mean square error of 1.63°C and a Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.76. The future projections of LST using the multimodel mean of all GCMs revealed an increase in average LST in Kuala Lumpur from 0.7°C (CI: 0.4°C–0.7°C) for SSP1-2.6 to 1.3°C (CI: 1.2°C–2.9°C) for SSP5-8.5. The projections of UHI showed an increase ranging from 1°C to 1.9°C for SSP1-2.6 and from 2.5°C to 3°C for SSP5-8.5 by 2090 compared to 2030. The results also highlight spatial heterogeneity in UHI expansion, with central urban zones experiencing the most significant warming. This study emphasises the necessity of integrating urban planning strategies, such as increased green spaces, improved urban design, and heat mitigation policies, to address the rising urban temperatures. © 2025 Royal Meteorological Society.",bias correction; CMIP6; earth skin temperature; fair subsample; machine learning-based downscaling; multi-model ensemble; random forest; SSPs; statistical downscaling; urban heat island effect,Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Data mining; Islanding; Land surface temperature; Learning systems; Machine learning; Random forests; Skin; Surface measurement; Thermal pollution; Urban planning; Bias correction; CMIP6; Down-scaling; Earth skin temperature; Fair subsample; Machine learning-based downscaling; Machine-learning; Multi-model ensemble; Shared socioeconomic pathway; Skin temperatures; Socio-economics; Statistical downscaling; Urban Heat Island Effects; Mean square error,,,,,,,"Admasu, Lualawi Mareshet, Exploring Global Climate Model Downscaling Based on Tile-Level Output, Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, 62, 2, pp. 171-190, (2023); Ali, Zulfiqar, A novel approach for evaluation of CMIP6 GCMs in simulating temperature and precipitation extremes of Pakistan, International Journal of Climatology, 44, 2, pp. 592-612, (2024); Almazroui, Mansour, Future Changes in Climate over the Arabian Peninsula based on CMIP6 Multimodel Simulations, Earth Systems and Environment, 4, 4, pp. 611-630, (2020); Amini, S., Urban Land Use and Land Cover Change Analysis Using Random Forest Classification of Landsat Time Series, Remote Sensing, 14, 11, (2022); Ayugi, Brian Odhiambo, Evaluation and projection of mean surface temperature using CMIP6 models over East Africa, Journal of African Earth Sciences, 181, (2021); Baqa, Muhammad Fahad, Monitoring and modeling the patterns and trends of urban growth using urban sprawl matrix and CA-Markov model: A case study of Karachi, Pakistan, Land, 10, 7, (2021); Belgiu, Mariana, Random forest in remote sensing: A review of applications and future directions, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 114, pp. 24-31, (2016); Benali, Akli Ait, Estimating air surface temperature in Portugal using MODIS LST data, Remote Sensing of Environment, 124, pp. 108-121, (2012); Carvalho, David, How well have CMIP3, CMIP5 and CMIP6 future climate projections portrayed the recently observed warming, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Chakraborty, T.

Numerous studies in the field do not adequately cover the topic. Existing studies focus on specific issues and neglect others. While some studies discuss future challenges, transformation, and urban imagination, others examine city trends, climate change, sustainability, technology, biomimicry, and decision-making. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between urban planning and future cities using two methodologies. A bibliometric analysis of the conceptual structure of 415 documents (1969–2024) from the best scholarly classifications was conducted. Additionally, conduct a survey of urban planners and city specialists on “salient challenges, enabling technologies, and preferred design trends.” The conceptual structure analysis yielded six main clusters: “Cities, Urbanization, and the Built Environment; Urban Design and Sustainability; Urban Planning and Future Cities; Smart Cities; Planning and Resilience; and Climate Change.” Results show a lack of consideration for urban identity and artificial intelligence in the planning of future cities. Urban planners must adopt a multidisciplinary approach, integrate insights from modern sciences like “complexity science,” ground the concept of “sustainable smart cities,” and enhance their professional skills to fully comprehend current updates. The study concludes with its relevance to urban planners and all city specialists, such as those in technology and the environment. The study emphasizes that the major challenge for planners is to integrate all concepts and disciplines into a unified, coherent system to achieve a sustainable future. © 2025 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Big data; Climate change; Future cities; Internet of things; Smart city; Sustainable development; Urban design; Urban planning,,,,,,,,"Abbott, Carl, Imagining urban futures: Cities in science fiction and what we might learn from them, pp. 1-272, (2016); Abosaleh, Al Husein Sami, Civic Fictions: Exploring the Socio-technical Implications of Augmented Reality in Future Cities through Science Fiction Prototyping, (2022); Admiraal, Han, Future cities, resilient cities – The role of underground space in achieving urban resilience, Underground Space (new), 5, 3, pp. 223-228, (2020); Agudelo-Vera, Claudia Marcela, Harvesting urban resources towards more resilient cities, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 64, pp. 3-12, (2012); Ahmed, Farhana, Tipping points in adaptation to urban flooding under climate change and urban growth: The case of the Dhaka megacity, Land Use Policy, 79, pp. 496-506, (2018); Akrofi, Mark M., Integrating solar energy considerations into urban planning for low carbon cities: A systematic review of the state-of-the-art, Urban Governance, 2, 1, pp. 157-172, (2022); Alesaily, Zaker Mousa, Future cities: A bibliometric review, 1875 to 2024, Sustainable Futures, 9, (2025); Alexandria Engineering Journal, (2025); Journal of Al Azhar University Engineering Sector, (2025); Allam, Zaheer, Research Structure and Trends of Smart Urban Mobility, Smart Cities, 5, 2, pp. 539-561, (2022)","Z.

This study tackles the challenge of sustainable urban development by employing three different deep learning models: the Edge-Attention U-Net, ResUNet, and UNet-FS. These models enable pixel-wise classification, facilitating precise allocation of various land use categories, including buildings, roads, vegetation, water bodies, and other crucial urban features in densely populated areas, exemplified by Dubai City. A comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Pixel accuracy, and class-specific metrics, is employed to assess the performance of the models. The comparative analysis reveals that the UNet-FS model outperforms the others, achieving a remarkable Jaccard coefficient of 0.9303, a Dice coefficient of 0.9637, and a pixel accuracy of 0.9885. The proposed Edge-Attention U-Net approach demonstrates exceptional accuracy in segmenting complex urban scenes and generating high-resolution land use maps for urban planning purposes. The incorporation of attention mechanisms enhances feature localization and reduces noise, contributing to reliable segmentation outcomes. This research advances remote sensing and urban studies by providing an efficient solution for land use classification and facilitating informed urban development strategies. The UNet-FS model’s exceptional performance in land use classification supports decision-making in urban development and sustainability endeavors.

This study explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve flood severity forecasting, thereby aiding sustainable urban planning. We conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of various AI models—including traditional regression techniques, ensemble methods, and advanced deep learning architectures—to enhance flood prediction accuracy and support resilient urban design. Using datasets from 25 diverse states encompassing a wide range of urban conditions and flood-related variables, we evaluated the performance of models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Lasso Regression, time-series models like ARIMA and SARIMA, and neural network architectures including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). The results demonstrate that deep learning models significantly outperform traditional approaches in predicting flood severity, evidenced by the lowest mean squared error (MSE). This suggests that AI-driven models can be effectively integrated into urban planning frameworks to enhance flood management strategies and promote sustainable development.

This review presents an innovative framework for ULBS research, integrating advanced techniques like Agent-Based Modeling, Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data Analytics. Through a systematic review of literature from 2010 to February 2024 across Scopus, Science Direct, and Taylor and Francis, we analyzed 212 methodologically influential articles, identified through bibliometric and thematic analyses, to uncover spatiotemporal trends, methodological advancements, and critical research gaps. A key contribution is the introduction of advanced probabilistic and optimization frameworks, extending beyond basic Bayesian models by incorporating weighted priors, information gain functions, and multi-objective optimization for evaluating methodological suitability. These frameworks enable adaptive method selection based on data characteristics, constraints, and objectives. Our findings highlight the need for real-time analytics, predictive modeling, and interactive tools to address data representativeness, methodological limitations, and interdisciplinary challenges. By promoting sophisticated evaluation techniques and integrating ethical considerations, this review aims to enhance the precision of ULBS research, supporting the development of sustainable, resilient, and inclusive urban environments that are better equipped to respond to the complexities of modern urban living. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Bayesian evaluation; behavioural science; literature review; methodological innovation; multi-objective optimization; Urban landscape,Bayesian networks; Behavioral research; Big data; Computational methods; Function evaluation; Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Urban planning; Bayesian evaluation; Behavioral science; Literature reviews; Methodological approach; Methodological innovations; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization framework; Probabilistic framework; Science research; Urban landscape; Multiobjective optimization,,,,,,,"Askarizad, Reza, Gender equality of privacy protection in the use of urban furniture in the Muslim context of Iran, Local Environment, 28, 10, pp. 1311-1330, (2023); Bai, Yiwei, Exploring Associations between the Built Environment and Cycling Behaviour around Urban Greenways from a Human-Scale Perspective, Land, 12, 3, (2023); Bandaru, Sunith, Data mining methods for knowledge discovery in multi-objective optimization: Part A - Survey, Expert Systems with Applications, 70, pp. 139-159, (2017); Bastidas, Viviana, Leadership for responsible digital innovation in the built environment: A socio-technical review for re-establishing competencies, Journal of Urban Management, 12, 1, pp. 57-73, (2023); Bibri, Simon Elias, On the social shaping dimensions of smart sustainable cities: A study in science, technology, and society, Sustainable Cities and Society, 29, pp. 219-246, (2017); Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, (2006); Brooks, Alex, Parametric POMDPs for planning in continuous state spaces, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 54, 11, pp. 887-897, (2006); Cai, Zipan, Urban spatial dynamic modeling based on urban amenity data to inform smart city planning, Anthropocene, 42, (2023); Canales, Marcos, Agent-based models of groundwater systems: A review of an emerging approach to simulate the interactions between groundwater and society, Environmental Modelling and Software, 175, (2024); Cao, Longbing, In-depth behavior understanding and use: The behavior informatics approach, Information Sciences, 180, 17, pp. 3067-3085, (2010)","M.

While AI has traditionally been applied to judicial prediction, this paper extends the scope by analyzing comparative developments across legal systems and their societal impacts, alongside links to urban safety and planning. Drawing on literature from SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the ROSES review protocol, the analysis identifies how AI-driven predictive systems intersect with crime geography, urban planning, and development strategies. Key opportunities include hotspot detection, GIS-based crime mapping, safer urban design, and efficient allocation of resources, while challenges include spatial bias, uneven surveillance, and the reinforcement of urban inequalities. By situating automated decision-making within spatial justice and sustainable development frameworks, this paper contributes to the field of social sciences and offers pathways for creating safer, fairer, and more resilient urban communities. © 2025, Green Publication.

However, research on the specific role of ornamental tree diversity during the urbanization process remained insufficient and required further exploration. This study used remote sensing data with 18 environmental variables, and combined MaxEnt ecological niche modeling with entropy-weighted overlay to simulate spatiotemporal changes characteristics of Coefficient of Ornamental Tree Diversity (COTD) for 17 ornamental tree species under 3 scenarios. We found that under the SSP1-RCP2.6 scenario, the COTD peaked at 0.211 in 2040, indicating that the spatial richness of ornamental tree species in urban areas was relatively high, an increase of 3.43% from 2020, but declined to 0.189 by 2050, with the high-value area contracting by 45%, suggesting potential challenges for maintaining biodiversity and ecological services in future urban environments. In the SSP2-RCP4.5 scenario, the COTD rose to 0.212 by 2030, decreased to 0.201 in 2040, and subsequently recovered to 0.211 by 2050, accompanied by a slight reduction in high-value areas and a significant increase of 5,110 km2 in moderately suitable areas. Under the SSP5-RCP8.5 scenario, the COTD exhibited a continuous decline to 0.197 by 2030, followed by a minor recovery to 0.199 by 2050, with a marginal decrease in high-value areas. The COTD is positively correlated with urbanization intensity (UI). In first-tier cities, the COTD demonstrated a linear increase with UI, with a 10% increase in impervious surface corresponding to increases in COTD of 0.051, 0.047, and 0.048, respectively. In emerging cities, the COTD rose rapidly when UI was less than or equal to 0.4, but the rate of increase diminished once UI exceeded 0.4. This study employed geographic remote sensing data to evaluate the indirect effects of urban development on plant growth, providing critical data for the future planning of urban ornamental tree species. © 2025 The Author(s).

The study focuses on Turin, Italy, leveraging its diverse urban architecture to develop a comprehensive model. A detailed 3D occupancy grid map, based on OpenStreetMap data, was created to represent buildings' locations and heights while a population density map was developed to account for demographic variances. The research develops a dynamic noise source model that adjusts noise emission levels based on UAV velocity, ensuring realistic noise impact predictions. Acoustic ray tracing techniques are utilised to simulate noise propagation, accounting for atmospheric absorption and reflections from urban structures, providing a detailed analysis of noise distribution. The core of this work is the application of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm within the RL framework. The algorithm is tailored to optimise flight paths by minimising noise impact while balancing other factors like path length and energy efficiency. The RL agent learns to navigate complex urban landscapes, integrating penalties for idling, excessive path length and abrupt manoeuvers to refine its path planning strategy. Simulation results with several maps unseen during training reveal that the RL-based approach effectively reduces noise impact in urban settings, making it a viable solution for better integrating UAVs into urban air mobility (UAM) systems. The methodology is scalable and adaptable, with potential applications in various urban environments globally. This research contributes to the development of sustainable drone operations in UAM context by addressing the critical issue of noise pollution, enhancing public acceptance and regulatory compliance. © The Author(s), 2025.

As urbanization intensifies in this region, understanding LULC dynamics is crucial for sustainable development and environmental conservation, particularly with the notable shift from forested areas to grasslands. Utilizing multi-spectral remote sensing techniques and machine learning models, this research employs satellite datasets, including Sentinel-2 and European Space Agency (ESA) World Cover, to analyze LULC changes. Various machine learning models, such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), were applied to assess their effectiveness in classification tasks. Among these, Random Forest emerged as the most effective model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97.59 %, attributed to its ability to robustly utilize key features for classification. The findings highlight the importance of feature selection, as different models prioritize various environmental indicators. The research highlights those geospatial technologies, including remote sensing and GIS, have their fair share of advantages and disadvantages in LULC change monitoring. Satellite imagery and machine learning permit accurate monitoring of land cover changes to render it useful to policymakers and urban planners for evidence-based decisions. In addition, the findings recommend avenue for further work in the areas of multi-temporal analysis, advanced feature engineering techniques, and ensemble-learning techniques to improve predictive abilities and model robustness for future applications. This study, therefore, highlights the need for developing sustainable urban design strategies, especially for Indonesia’s new capital in East Kalimantan, to complement economic development with environmental conservation. © 2025 COSPAR.

This study examines the complex relationship between building configurations and integrated green spaces, as well as their combined impact on thermal regulation. It focuses on addressing data quality issues commonly encountered in remote sensing applications. Using high-resolution multispectral and thermal imagery, we developed an integrated modeling approach that captures the collective influence of built form and green infrastructure on urban microclimates. A key finding is the significant linear inverse relationship between green space coverage and land surface temperature, underscoring the cooling potential of strategically planned green zones. However, achieving robust insights required addressing several data quality challenges, including image misalignment, atmospheric distortions, variable spatial resolutions, and annotation inconsistencies, which can compromise model performance. We applied preprocessing methods, including geometric correction, atmospheric calibration, and multisource data fusion, alongside rigorous ground truthing using in situ temperature measurements. We also implemented data augmentation and label refinement strategies to enhance the training of deep learning models for thermal pattern prediction. This study demonstrates that, when properly corrected, urban microclimate models can accurately capture temperature variations of up to 3.5 °C across similar urban settings, providing actionable insights for thermal comfort planning. This study highlights the critical role of high-quality preprocessed remote sensing data in enabling reliable analysis and offers a framework for integrating urban design and green infrastructure to mitigate UHI effects.

Traditional methods often struggle in underground structures or densely built urban zones where sensor data is obstructed or noisy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel integration of multiple cameras and radars, leveraging their complementary strengths to enhance overall perception accuracy. This approach moves beyond the limitations of single-sensor systems, combining the detailed visual data from cameras with the robust distance and velocity measurements from radars. Our innovative framework, MultiFusionNet, incorporates deep learning, adaptive multimodal fusion, and multiscale attention mechanisms to dynamically adjust to varying environmental conditions and complex sensor data interactions. Additionally, we introduce the scene-aware spatiotemporal network (SA-STNet) to refine radar data and improve its resolution and temporal coherence. By optimizing sensor placement with an uncertainty-aware probabilistic metric, we achieve comprehensive environmental coverage and significantly enhance the reliability of autonomous navigation. By optimizing sensor placement with an uncertainty-aware probabilistic metric, we achieve comprehensive environmental coverage, leading to improved detection accuracy (e.g., 0.88 AP and 0.90 recall) in simulated urban scenarios, paving the way for enhanced autonomous navigation reliability pending real-world validation. Validated through extensive simulations in the CARLA-generated datasets, our framework demonstrates notable improvements in detection accuracy, offering a robust solution for navigating complex and challenging urban landscapes. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",3-D object detection; autonomous vehicles; multisensor fusion; radar–camera integration,Autonomous vehicles; Cameras; Deep learning; Navigation; Object detection; Object recognition; Radar measurement; Sensor data fusion; Tracking radar; Uncertainty analysis; Underground structures; Urban planning; 3D object; 3d object detection; Autonomous Vehicles; Multi-sensor fusion; Objects detection; Radar-camera integration; Sensor placement; Sensors data; Spatio-temporal; Uncertainty; Complex networks,,,,,,,"Li, Yingwei, DeepFusion: Lidar-Camera Deep Fusion for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022-June, pp. 17161-17170, (2022); Banerjee, Koyel, Online Camera LiDAR Fusion and Object Detection on Hybrid Data for Autonomous Driving, 2018-June, pp. 1632-1638, (2018); Nabati, Ramin, CenterFusion: Center-based radar and camera fusion for 3d object detection, pp. 1526-1535, (2021); Ros, Germán, Vision-based offline-online perception paradigm for autonomous driving, pp. 231-238, (2015); Chen, Siheng, 3D Point Cloud Processing and Learning for Autonomous Driving: Impacting Map Creation, Localization, and Perception, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 38, 1, pp. 68-86, (2021); Zhang, Lu, Weakly Aligned Feature Fusion for Multimodal Object Detection, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 36, 3, pp. 4145-4159, (2025); Qiu, Sen, Multi-sensor information fusion based on machine learning for real applications in human activity recognition: State-of-the-art and research challenges, Information Fusion, 80, pp. 241-265, (2022); IEEE Transactions on Big Data, (2016); Feng, Di, Deep Multi-Modal Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving: Datasets, Methods, and Challenges, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 22, 3, pp. 1341-1360, (2021); Danzer, Andreas, 2D Car Detection in Radar Data with PointNets, pp. 61-66, (2019)","M.

PSO demonstrated the best scenario in both cases with an optimum convergence rate of 24.1%; ACO produced almost the same best result as mentioned with high rates of reductions in carbon footprints. These had their best energy-savings while convergence in GA and SA was extremely slow with energy efficiencies that turned out to be pretty low.

Through the provision of advanced technologies, law enforcement organisations will be able to allocate resources, make data-driven, and informed decisions on crime prevention. The empirical study also sheds light on the effects of regional and contextual changes on crime prediction by revealing the performance differences of different models across cities. Focusing on the vibrant dynamics of two major cities, the empirical study offers an in-depth exploration of crime classification and prediction. Twelve distinct models were employed to classify crimes based on location and associated factors, which will help to analyse historical crime data and identify patterns and trends. The accuracy of each model was assessed to discern the effectiveness in predicting the occurrence of crime in different places. In the context of New York City, the models achieved remarkable accuracy with the highest reaching 99.94% meanwhile in San Francisco achieved an accuracy of 94.27%.

The complex, nonlinear interconnections of environmental and human elements cause terrain instability and challenge conventional prediction methods. In this work, we offer a DeepLabV3+-based deep learning framework coupled with geographic information systems and multicriteria decision making methods for spatial prediction of landslide risk, over the Dubai coastal and urban region (covering approximately 4000 km2). The approach uses an annotated dataset for semantic segmentation and high-resolution satellite images from the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center. On Google Colab with GPU acceleration, the model is trained and verified and then further improved for computational efficiency on a Mac M1 machine. Our results show an overall accuracy of 91.3%, a mean intersection over union of 82.5%, and an F1-score of 88.4%, demonstrating strong classification performance throughout a range of land cover types. The confusion matrix analysis highlights strong segmentation accuracy for water bodies (94.2%) and structures (92.4%). Considerable misclassification between roadways and unpaved terrain results from spectral similarities. Furthermore, the perclass Dice Coefficient analysis confirms that the model can efficiently discriminate intricate topographical patterns. Especially in fast-expanding areas such as Dubai, UAE, it provides a scalable solution for landslide susceptibility mapping, catastrophe risk management, and sustainable urban design.

This study advances urban morphology evaluation by combining Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) with machine learning models (MLMs) and Explainable AI techniques, specifically Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Using Tehran’s dense urban landscape as a case study, this research assesses and ranks the impact of 30 morphology parameters at the urban block level on key energy metrics (cooling, heating, and lighting demand) and environmental performance (sunlight exposure, photovoltaic generation, and Sky View Factor). Among seven ML algorithms evaluated, the XGBoost model was the most effective predictor, achieving high accuracy (R²: 0.92) and a training time of 3.64 seconds. Findings reveal that building shape, window-to-wall ratio, and commercial ratio are the most critical parameters affecting energy efficiency, while the heights and distances of neighbouring buildings strongly influence cooling demand and solar access. By evaluating urban blocks with varied densities and configurations, this study offers generalizable insights applicable to other dry-arid regions. Moreover, the integration of UBEM and Explainable AI offers a scalable, data-driven framework for developing climate-responsive urban designs adaptable to high-density environments worldwide. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",machine learning; sensitivity analysis; sustainable urban development; Urban morphology; urban planning,Climate change; Ecodesign; Energy conservation; Environmental design; Environmental impact; Environmental management systems; Green development; Sustainable building; Sustainable development; Walls (structural partitions); 'Dry' [; Arid climates; Building energy model; Environmental performance; Machine-learning; Sensitivity analyzes; Sustainable urban development; Urban blocks; Urban buildings; Urban morphology; Sensitivity analysis,,,,,,,"undefined; Ahmadian, Ehsan, Effect of urban built form and density on building energy performance in temperate climates, Energy and Buildings, 236, (2021); Alfeo, Antonio Luca, From local counterfactuals to global feature importance: efficient, robust, and model-agnostic explanations for brain connectivity networks, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 236, (2023); Ali, Usman, A data-driven approach to optimize urban scale energy retrofit decisions for residential buildings, Applied Energy, 267, (2020); Ali, Usman, A data-driven approach for multi-scale GIS-based building energy modeling for analysis, planning and support decision making, Applied Energy, 279, (2020); Ali, Usman, Review of urban building energy modeling (UBEM) approaches, methods and tools using qualitative and quantitative analysis, Energy and Buildings, 246, (2021); Alijani, Saeideh, A new approach of urban livability in Tehran: Thermal comfort as a primitive indicator.

Existing research often relies on survey-based or linear regression methods, which are limited in scope, coverage, and their ability to capture nonlinear associations. This study addresses these gaps by combining homeless incident reports from New York City’s 311 service with multi-source urban big data and employing a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model alongside SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Through a census tract-level analysis, we examine how socioeconomic, built environment, transportation, and urban landscape factors relate to homelessness incidence. Our findings show that (1) the importance of predictive factors varies across location types, for instance, information, and communication POIs are most predictive in commercial areas, while felony crime and median income dominate in residential zones; (2) socioeconomic and built environment features are consistently more important than transportation and visual landscape indicators; and (3) many factors exhibit nonlinear relationships and threshold effects, such as sharp increases in homelessness beyond a median rent of $1800 or Gini index of 0.53. These findings offer new insights into the spatial distribution and drivers of homelessness and underscore the value of interpretable machine learning in urban analytics. By identifying key environmental thresholds, this study provides evidence-based guidance for spatially targeted urban interventions, such as prioritizing support services in high-risk areas and designing inclusive public spaces that can help mitigate homelessness and promote more sustainable and equitable cities. © The Author(s) 2025.",Homelessness; interpretable machine learning; SHapley additive explanations; street view imagery; urban big data,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (2314709); National Science Foundation, NSF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation, USA (No. 2314709).","Adadi, Amina, Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); European Journal of Homelessness, (2011); Social Justice, (2003); Homelessness in the United States and Its Effects on the Economy, (2024); 1996 National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients A Comparison of Faith Based and Secular Non Profit Programs, (2002); Barton, Michael S., A stop too far: How does public transportation concentration influence neighbourhood median household income?, Urban Studies, 54, 2, pp. 538-554, (2017); Batterham, Deb, Defining “At-risk of Homelessness”: Re-connecting Causes, Mechanisms and Risk, Housing, Theory and Society, 36, 1, pp. 1-24, (2019); Bensken, Wyatt P., Health status and chronic disease burden of the homeless population: An analysis of two decades of multi- institutional electronic medical records, Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved, 32, 3, pp. 1619-1634, (2021); Criminology Public Policy, (2010); Bocarejo, Juan Pablo, An innovative transit system and its impact on low income users: The case of the Metrocable in Medellín, Journal of Transport Geography, 39, pp. 49-61, (2014)","S.

Vast amounts of urban data can now be collected, providing more accurate and intuitive presentation and analysis tools. This enhances the research on the built environment from a human-centered perspective. In this paper, with the help of the CiteSpace knowledge map analysis tool, manual deep intervention was combined with clustering and stratified sampling of literature information to identify hot topics and research trends. The results demonstrate that there are two new perspectives. The first is the up-bottom urban/group perspective, specifically a holistic study of group perceptions by large-scale data, represented by big data, with technologies such as artificial intelligence. The second is the bottom-up humanistic/individual perspective, which accurately examines individual perceptions through physiological data based on ergonomics techniques, psychological, and other small-scale data. Furthermore, these two perspectives are interconnected, indicating a cross-trend in both directions. By bridging the gap between subjective perception and the real-world environment, integrating multi-source data offers a more precise and efficient foundation for thoroughly evaluating the built environment, which would help us better understand the built environment and satisfy the users’ demands in the research and practice of urban design. © 2024 The Author(s).

Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models were developed to estimate the electric field (E, in V/m) at specific locations without requiring direct measurements. Measurements were conducted in Thessaloniki, Greece, covering a diverse urban landscape, including commercial and residential areas. The methodology involved collecting EMF data using high-precision equipment, validating and refining publicly available datasets, and extracting key features using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Essential input features included distances to the nearest base stations, their installation heights, classification of base stations regarding their emitted power, number of obstructing buildings, built area density, and line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. The AI models demonstrated strong predictive performance, with mean absolute errors (MAE) slightly above 0.3 V/m. The study highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing, feature selection, and integration of real-world measurements into AI-based prediction models. The results suggest that AI can serve as a reliable alternative for EMF exposure assessment, potentially reducing the need for costly and time-consuming field measurements while ensuring compliance with safety regulations. © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence (AI); base station (BS) antennas; deep learning (DL); Electromagnetic field (EMF) prediction; machine learning (ML); radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF),Electromagnetic field measurement; Artificial intelligence; Base station antennas; Deep learning; Electromagnetic field prediction; Electromagnetic field exposure; Electromagnetics; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Radiofrequency electromagnetic field,,,,,"HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme, (101057622)",This work was supported by the European Union\u2019s Horizon Europe Framework Program (SEAWave Project) under Grant 101057622.,"Ziegelberger, Gunde, Guidelines for limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields (100 kHz to 300 GHz), Health Physics, 118, 5, pp. 483-524, (2020); Sarkar, Tapan Kumar, A Survey of Various Propagation Models for Mobile Communication, IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, 45, 3, pp. 51-82, (2003); Rev Elec Commun Lab, (1968); European Commission, (1999); Neškovič, Aleksandar M., Indoor electric field level prediction model based on the artificial neural networks, IEEE Communications Letters, 4, 6, pp. 190-192, (2000); Tognola, Gabriella, Use of Machine Learning for the Estimation of Down- and Up-Link Field Exposure in Multi-Source Indoor WiFi Scenarios, Bioelectromagnetics, 42, 7, pp. 550-561, (2021); Mazloum, Taghrid, Artificial Neural Network-Based Uplink Power Prediction From Multi-Floor Indoor Measurement Campaigns in 4G Networks, Frontiers in Public Health, 9, (2021); Liu, Sen, A Generalizable Indoor Propagation Model Based on Graph Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, 71, 7, pp. 6098-6110, (2023); Bilson, Samuel, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Modelling of RF-EMF Exposure in Massive MIMO Systems, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 69410-69422, (2024); Neškovič, Aleksandar M., Microcell electric field strength prediction model based upon artificial neural networks, AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications, 64, 8, pp. 733-738, (2010)","A.

The phenomenon of UPD is also undergoing a process of evolution in conjunction with the developments that are taking place in urban areas. Measuring the evolution of UPD remains a challenge, however. This study innovatively employed time-series street view images and deep learning to analyze the temporal evolution of UPD on a nationwide scale, encompassing both overall levels and diverse manifestations. A total of 20 million street view images were collected in China from 2013 to 2022. The YOLOv8 object detection model was trained to accurately identify fourteen UPD elements. Subsequently, each element was assigned a weight to reflect the overall level of UPD. A clustering analysis based on graph neural networks identified four distinct manifestations, which were found to vary considerably across cities: good quality, vacancy and decay, under construction, and poor maintenance. The findings indicate a decrease in the overall level of UPD in China, with the primary issue shifting from poor maintenance to vacancy and decay. Economic growth correlates with overall improvements in UPD, whereas cities experiencing population decline tend to have more vacancies. The approach to measuring the evolution of UPD allows for a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon and facilitates the prediction of urban space quality challenges, hence assisting urban planners in devising specific strategies for improvement. © 2025 by American Association of Geographers.",graph neural networks; neighborhood disorder; spatiotemporal changes; street view image; urban space quality,artificial neural network; cluster analysis; detection method; economic growth; machine learning; prediction; temporal evolution; time series; urban planning; China,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62394331, 62394335, 52178044); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 62394331, 62394335, 52178044].","Annear, M.

Numerical simulations, such as computational fluid dynamics and multi-scale modeling techniques, are commonly used for wind environment analysis. However, they are computationally intensive and time-consuming, particularly when dealing with the complexities of urban landscapes. This study proposes a novel Multi-Factor-Fusion (MFF) framework that leverages deep learning techniques. This framework integrates Graph Convolutional Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to extract and fuse multiple factors and create an end-to-end neural network model capable of directly predicting wind fields. By avoiding the need for grid division and iterative calculations, the framework significantly enhances the efficiency of wind environment analysis. Furthermore, multi-scale simulation data is used to train the model and correct the predictive results, ensuring the accuracy of the final results. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the Pedestrian-Level Wind Environment prediction by achieving a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. © 2025 IEEE.",deep learning; green building; numerical simulation; Wind environment,Digital elevation model; Computational fluid; Deep learning; Efficient predictions; Environment analysis; Fluid-dynamics; Green buildings; Living environment; Multi-factor; Pedestrian level wind environment; Wind environment; Wind forecasting,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKPs, (2022YFC3801100); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2022B1515130006)","This project was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFC3801100), and the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2022B1515130006).","Du, Yaxing, New criteria for assessing low wind environment at pedestrian level in Hong Kong, Building and Environment, 123, pp. 23-36, (2017); Zahid Iqbal, Qureshi M., Pedestrian level wind environment assessment around group of high-rise cross-shaped buildings: Effect of building shape, separation and orientation, Building and Environment, 101, pp. 45-63, (2016); Zhang, Xuelin, Evaluation of pedestrian wind comfort near ‘lift-up’ buildings with different aspect ratios and central core modifications, Building and Environment, 124, pp. 245-257, (2017); Abd Razak, Azli, Analysis of airflow over building arrays for assessment of urban wind environment, Building and Environment, 59, pp. 56-65, (2013); Weerasuriya, A.

Yet, many of the global issues we have begun with stand still while some of them took a much more severe course. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are unambiguous. What is unclear is the way to propel our socio-economic organizations into the desired performances. Regarding performance control, the built environment is arguably the most critical system. Every year, we add more urbanized land to the face of the planet without clearly envisioning its environmental effects and social outgrowth. As a result, we frequently find ourselves struggling with unpleasant consequences and unpredicted side effects. In our body of knowledge, there is a missing link between urban structure and performance. This paper offers a systemic breakdown of urban structural parameters and a coherent reading of its performance indicators intending to create a City Information Modelling (CIM) tool. The objective is to formulate the reciprocal relationship between the components of the built environment (as the designer's toolbox) and the system's outcome. To do so, this article moves from the Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM), exploring it through the lens of an Entity-Relationship (ER) schema, delving into its systemic approach to model the built environment as a Complex Adaptive System (CAS). IMM elucidates the intricate structure/performance relationships inherent in the complexity of the built environment. Building upon the successful IMM application in numerous urban transformation projects and retrofitting procedures, our focus is now on streamlining operational processes and accelerating workflow efficiency. Specifically, we seek to optimize the rapid assessment of correlations between structural changes and performance outcomes within the IMM framework.

This paper contrasts the impact of these factors individually, such as the immigrant rate and neighborhood segregation. To achieve this, a machine learning analysis was conducted on a sample of neighborhoods in the main Spanish metropolitan areas (Madrid and Barcelona), using a database created from a combination of official statistical sources and textual sources, such as Wikipedia. These texts were transformed into indexes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other artificial intelligence algorithms capable of interpreting images and converting them into indexes. The results indicate that the factors influencing immigrant concentration and segregation differ significantly, with crucial roles played by the urban landscape, population size, and geographic origin.

Urban populations are particularly exposed to high concentrations of air pollutants, such as particulate matter smaller than 10 µm (PM<inf>10</inf>). Understanding the spatiotemporal variations of PM<inf>10</inf> is essential for developing effective control strategies. This study aimed to enhance PM<inf>10</inf> prediction models by integrating landscape metrics as ecological indicators into our previous models, assessing their significance in monthly average PM<inf>10</inf> concentrations, and analyzing their correlations with PM<inf>10</inf> air pollution across European urban landscapes during heating (cold) and non-heating (warm) seasons. In our previous research, we only calculated the proportion of land uses (PLANDs), but according to our current research hypothesis, landscape metrics have a significant impact on PM<inf>10</inf> air quality. Therefore, we expanded our independent variables by incorporating landscape metrics that capture compositional heterogeneity, including the Shannon diversity index (SHDI), as well as metrics that reflect configurational heterogeneity in urban landscapes, such as the Mean Patch Area (MPA) and Shape Index (SHI). Considering data from 1216 European air quality (AQ) stations, we applied the Random Forest model using cross-validation to discover patterns and complex relationships. Climatological factors, such as monthly average temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and mean sea level air pressure, emerged as key predictors, particularly during the heating season when the impact of temperature on PM<inf>10</inf> prediction increased from 5.80% to 22.46% at 3 km. Landscape metrics, including the SHDI, MPA, and SHI, were significantly related to the monthly average PM<inf>10</inf> concentration. The SHDI was negatively correlated with PM<inf>10</inf> levels, suggesting that heterogeneous landscapes could help mitigate pollution. Our enhanced model achieved an R² of 0.58 in the 1000 m buffer zone and 0.66 in the 3000 m buffer zone, underscoring the utility of these variables in improving PM<inf>10</inf> predictions. Our findings suggest that increased urban landscape complexity, smaller patch sizes, and more fragmented land uses associated with PM<inf>10</inf> sources such as built-up areas, along with larger and more evenly distributed green spaces, can contribute to the control and reduction of PM<inf>10</inf> pollution. © 2024 by the authors.",European cities; land use; machine learning; PM10; random forest; urban ecology,atmospheric pollution; atmospheric pressure; complexity; concentration (composition); emission control; greenspace; land use planning; landscape structure; machine learning; particulate matter; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; Europe,,,,,,,"Kuerban, Mireadili, Spatio-temporal patterns of air pollution in China from 2015 to 2018 and implications for health risks, Environmental Pollution, 258, (2020); Zhang, Zhaoya, Forecasting PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations using GMCN(1,N) model with the similar meteorological condition: Case of Shijiazhuang in China, Ecological Indicators, 119, (2020); Žibert, Janez, Particulate matter (PM10) patterns in Europe: An exploratory data analysis using non-negative matrix factorization, Atmospheric Environment, 132, pp. 217-228, (2016); Subramanian, Ahila, The Exposome and Asthma, Clinics in Chest Medicine, 40, 1, pp. 107-123, (2019); Beloconi, Anton, Revised EU and WHO air quality thresholds: Where does Europe stand?, Atmospheric Environment, 314, (2023); Official Journal of the European Union, (2008); Off J Eur Union, (2024); Guerreiro, Cristina B.B., Air quality status and trends in Europe, Atmospheric Environment, 98, pp. 376-384, (2014); Vardoulakis, Sotiris, Sources and factors affecting PM10 levels in two European cities: Implications for local air quality management, Atmospheric Environment, 42, 17, pp. 3949-3963, (2008); Uuemaa, Evelyn, Trends in the use of landscape spatial metrics as landscape indicators: A review, Ecological Indicators, 28, pp. 100-106, (2013)","S.

OMS, as a key element in modern urban design, significantly enhances residents’ quality of life and promotes public health. Accurately understanding and predicting users’ emotional needs is the core challenge in optimizing OMS. In this study, the Kansei Engineering (KE) framework is applied, using fuzzy clustering to reduce the dimensionality of emotional descriptors, while RST is employed for attribute reduction to select five key design features that influence users’ emotions. Subsequently, the PSO-SVR model is applied to establish the nonlinear mapping relationship between these design features and users’ emotions, predicting the optimal configuration of OMS design. The results indicate that the optimized OMS design significantly enhances users’ intention to stay in the space, as reflected by higher ratings for emotional descriptors and increased preferences for longer outdoor activity duration, all exceeding the median score of the scale. Additionally, comparative analysis shows that the PSO-SVR model outperforms traditional methods (e.g., BPNN, RF, and SVR) in terms of accuracy and generalization for predictions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the emotional performance of OMS design and offers a solid optimization framework along with practical guidance for future urban public space design. The innovative contribution of this study lies in the proposed data-driven optimization method that integrates machine learning and KE. This method not only offers a new theoretical perspective for OMS design but also establishes a scientific framework to accurately incorporate users’ emotional needs into the design process. The method contributes new knowledge to the field of urban design, promotes public health and well-being, and provides a solid foundation for future applications in different urban environments. © 2024 by the authors.",Kansei engineering; outdoor micro-space; PSO-SVR algorithm; rough set theory; urban design,Architectural design; Behavioral research; Dimensionality reduction; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy set theory; Machine design; Space applications; Structural dynamics; Support vector regression; Urban planning; Vector spaces; Activity duration; Kansei Engineering; Outdoor micro-space; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization–support vector regression algorithm; Sets theory; Space design; Support vector regression algorithms; Swarm optimization; Urban design; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),,,,,-1400152019,"This research was funded by Tracking Program for Specially Appointed Professors (Oriental Scholars) in Shanghai Universities, grant number 1400152019.","Bull, Fiona C., World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 54, 24, pp. 1451-1462, (2020); Mouratidis, Kostas, Urban planning and quality of life: A review of pathways linking the built environment to subjective well-being, Cities, 115, (2021); Dong, Guanpeng, Spatial random slope multilevel modeling using multivariate conditional autoregressive models: A case study of subjective travel satisfaction in Beijing, Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 106, 1, pp. 19-35, (2016); Feng, Jianxi, The impact of neighbourhood environments on quality of life of elderly people: Evidence from Nanjing, China, Urban Studies, 55, 9, pp. 2020-2039, (2018); Gomes, Thayse Natacha Queiroz Ferreira, Physical activity in outdoor spaces, sleep quality and general health: a pilot feasibility study, The Lancet, 402, (2023); Coventry, Peter A., Nature-based outdoor activities for mental and physical health: Systematic review and meta-analysis, SSM - Population Health, 16, (2021); Cindrich, Sydney L., Associations Between Change in Outside Time Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Public Health Restrictions and Mental Health: Brief Research Report, Frontiers in Public Health, 9, (2021); Korpela, Kalevi Mikael, Analyzing the mediators between nature-based outdoor recreation and emotional well-being, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 37, pp. 1-7, (2014); Pop Stand, (2024); Pazhuhan, Mousa, Factors underlying life quality in urban contexts: Evidence from an industrial city (arak, iran), Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 6, (2020)","H.

However, increasing natural and anthropogenic stressors place significant pressure on these wetlands, threatening their ability to sustain these vital services. To effectively assess wetland condition and develop appropriate management strategies, robust monitoring tools are needed. Statistical learning techniques, such as machine learning, have been proposed as a promising approach to enhance the development of these wetland monitoring tools. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the pre-existing wetland assessment tool used in the City of Calgary—the Aquatic Condition Index (ACI). We compared ACI performance using three different approaches for selecting indicators: machine-only selection, expert-only selection, and a hybrid approach where humans selected the indicators, but the machine determined the relationships between the indicators and wetland conditions. Our results showed that hybrid approaches, combining human expertise with statistical learning, outperformed both machine-only and expert-only methods. We then examined whether the ACI could be transitioned from field- and computer-based indicators to fully computer-based indicators using the hybrid method of selecting indicators. Our findings revealed comparable results between the two methods, suggesting that a computer-based monitoring system could help overcome the time and budgetary constraints associated with field-based monitoring while also enabling the examination of larger geographical areas. This study underscores the importance of human expertise in guiding the statistical learning process, particularly in the selection of indicators that accurately represent wetland processes. © 2024 The Authors",Machine learning; Neural networks; Wetland assessment; Wetland management,Condition index; Hybrid approach; Machine-learning; Monitoring tools; Neural-networks; Performance; Statistical learning techniques; Wetland assessment; Wetland condition; Wetland management; Anthropogenic; artificial neural network; monitoring system; performance assessment; urban area; wetland management; Alberta; Calgary; Canada,,,,,"Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, ACI; Environment and Climate Change Canada, ECCC; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (05265-2019); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; (EDF-CA-2021i023)","The ACI survey tool development and testing were generously funded by The City of Calgary .

While macro-level built environment attributes (e.g., land use) have been widely acknowledged in relation to the role they play in urban traffic safety, the effects of micro-level streetscape characteristics on crash frequency have not been investigated to any significant extent. Moreover, the associations between these environmental features and crashes in school zones remains largely unknown. To address this issue, we first identified school zone-related crash hotspot using spatiotemporal hotspot mining on a comprehensive dataset of 20,484 pedestrian-vehicle crashes between 2017 and 2021 in Seoul, South Korea. Streetscape characteristics were analysed using street view imagery and advanced computer vision techniques to extract and classify pixel-wise visual elements. Preliminary findings reveal spatiotemporal variations in fatal and severe injury (FSI) crashes, with school zones in central commercial and industrial areas emerging as persistent crash hotspots that have remained statistically significant hotspots for 90 % of the study period. Further impact analysis using interpretable machine learning helped to uncover the non-linear relationships between both micro and macro environmental features and FSI frequency. Lower levels of street enclosure and walkability were associated with a higher frequency of FSI crashes, while increased openness and imageability were also correlated with more FSI incidents. Additionally, street greenery was found to reduce FSI crashes once it reached a certain threshold.

To encourage such activities, understanding urban bikeability at both detailed and broad spatial scales is crucial. Street view imagery (SVI) offers in-depth insights into how street features influence micro-mobility patterns, but existing studies are mainly correlational. This research utilized historical time-series SVI, cyclist data from London, to discern the causal effects of specific urban features on cyclist numbers. We used propensity score matching to adjust for potential confounding biases and applied the causal forest to estimate the heterogeneity in causal effects. Key findings include: vegetation significantly boosts cycling, slope negatively impacts cycling, and bike lanes positively influence cycling. Moreover, vegetation's impact on cycling is greater in less populated areas, while bike lanes have a stronger effect in densely populated regions. These findings help prioritize the areas of intervention. By transcending from mere correlations to identifying heterogeneous causal impacts, this study offers invaluable insights for urban planning, underscoring design strategies to enhance cities’ bikeability and sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Active transportation; Causal forest; Deep learning; Propensity score matching; Urban design,Active transportations; Built environment; Causal forest; Deep learning; Micro-mobility; Mobility pattern; Propensity score matching; Spatial scale; Times series; Urban design; Abiotic; heterogeneity; machine learning; sustainable development; time series analysis; urban design,,,,,"National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-295-000-171-133); National University of Singapore, NUS","The first author is thankful for funding provided by the Singapore International Graduate Research Award scholarship.

With the increase in urban population density and traffic flow, optimizing urban environmental design to elevate residents’ sense of safety has become a key issue in urban planning and management. However, the existing studies face numerous challenges in conducting large-scale quantitative analysis of environmental safety perception in complex scenarios, such as difficulties in data acquisition and limitations in analytical methods. This study addresses these challenges by applying image semantic segmentation and object detection techniques to extract key visual elements from street view images, combined with manual scoring and deep learning methods, to construct a road safety perception dataset. Using a LightGBM model and the SHAP interpretation framework, in this study, we identify the critical visual factors influencing environmental safety perception. An empirical study was conducted in Macau, a modern city where Eastern and Western cultures intersect, and tourism thrives. The findings reveal that: ① The overall environmental safety perception in the eight parishes and surrounding roads of Macau is relatively high, with significant regional differences in safety perception scores around Macau’s parish roads; ② The proportions of buildings, sidewalks, roads, and trees in images are the four primary factors influencing environmental safety perception; ③ The proportions and quantities of visual elements interact with each other, and their reasonable distribution helps form clear spatial visibility and creates conducive activity spaces, thereby enhancing the perception of environmental safety. Through empirical analysis, this study uncovers the mechanisms by which visual elements in urban street scenes affect environmental safety perception, providing scientific evidence for urban planning and transportation environment improvement. The research holds theoretical significance and offers practical references for urban design and management, demonstrating broad application value. © The Author(s) 2024.",Environmental perception; Image semantic segmentation; Macau; Machine learning; Object detection; Street view images,,,,,,"Jinan Office of Philosophy and Social Science, (GD24XYS018)","This research was funded by: 1) Guangdong Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project (GD24XYS018). 2) Guangdong Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project (GD24XSH06). 3) 2023 Maoming Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project (2023YB18). 4) Projects of Talents Recruitment of GDUPT (2023rcyj2015). 5) Projects of PhDs\u2019 Start-up Research of GDUPT (2023bsqd1008, 2022bsqd2004). 6) Science and Technology Programme of Maoming of Guangdong Province of China (2023398, 2023411, 2024055, 2024061).","Kou, Shihao, Delineating China's Urban Traffic Layout by Integrating Complex Graph Theory and Road Network Data, Journal of Geo-Information Science, 23, 5, pp. 812-824, (2021); Cities for People, (2010); Ordonez, Vicente, Learning high-level judgments of urban perception, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8694 LNCS, PART 6, pp. 494-510, (2014); Space and Place the Perspective of Experience, (1977); Kaplan, Rachel, The experience of nature: a psychological perspective, (1989); Ulrich, Roger S., Stress recovery during exposure to natural and urban environments, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 11, 3, pp. 201-230, (1991); Image of the City, (1960); Ma, Xintong, Critical factors influencing the comfort evaluation for recreational walking in urban street environments, Cities, 116, (2021); Duncan, Mitch J., Geographic location, physical activity and perceptions of the environment in Queensland adults, Health and Place, 15, 1, pp. 204-209, (2009); Weimann, Hanna, Perception of safety is a prerequisite for the association between neighbourhood green qualities and physical activity: Results from a cross-sectional study in Sweden, Health and Place, 45, pp. 124-130, (2017)","H.

Understanding the temporal variation of the relationship between PM<inf>10</inf> and geographical parameters is crucial for sustainable land use planning and air quality management in European landscapes. This study utilizes Conditional Inference Forest modeling and partial correlation to examine the impact of geographical factors on monthly average concentrations of PM<inf>10</inf> in European suburban and urban landscapes during heating and cooling periods. The investigation focuses on two buffer zones (1000 m and 3000 m circle radiuses) surrounding 1216 European air quality monitoring stations. Results: Results reveal importance and significant correlations between various geographical variables (soil texture, land use, transportation network, and meteorological) and PM<inf>10</inf> quality on a continental scale. In suburban landscapes, soil texture, temperature, roads, and rail density play pivotal roles, while meteorological variables, particularly monthly average temperature and wind speed, dominate in urban landscapes. Urban sites exhibit higher R-squared values during both cooling (0.41) and heating periods (0.61) compared to suburban sites (cooling period R-squared: 0.39; heating period: R-squared: 0.51), indicating better predictive performance likely attributed to the less heterogeneous land use patterns surrounding urban PM<inf>10</inf> monitoring sites. Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of investigating spatial and temporal dynamics of geographical factors for accurate PM<inf>10</inf> air quality prediction models in European urban and suburban landscapes. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and environmental scientists, guiding efforts toward sustainable and healthier urban environments. © The Author(s) 2024.",Land use; Meteorological condition; Particulate matter; Random forest; Soil texture; Spatiotemporal variability,Air quality; Quality management; Random forests; Urban transportation; Geographical parameters; Heating period; Machine learning algorithms; Meteorological condition; Particulate Matter; PM 10; Soil textures; Spatiotemporal variability; Urban landscape; Wind; algorithm; land use planning; machine learning; meteorology; particulate matter; soil texture; spatial variation; temporal variation,,,,,,,"Abbey, David E., Long-term inhalable particles and other air pollutants related to mortality in nonsmokers, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 159, 2, pp. 373-382, (1999); Alhems, Luai M., Comprehensive review of cooling and heating degree days characteristics over Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 27, pp. 305-314, (2013); Alizadeh, Omid, Temporal and spatial variations of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants in the urban area of Tehran, Atmospheric Environment, 141, pp. 443-453, (2016); Analitis, Antonis, Prediction of PM2.5 concentrations at the locations of monitoring sites measuring PM10 and NOx, using generalized additive models and machine learning methods: A case study in London, Atmospheric Environment, 240, (2020); Bai, Lu, Air pollution forecasts: An overview, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 4, (2018); Ballabio, Cristiano, Mapping topsoil physical properties at European scale using the LUCAS database, Geoderma, 261, pp. 110-123, (2016); Barrero, M.

In this paper, the multi-sensor collaborative filtering algorithm is optimized, and a method based on evidence theory is proposed to deal with the fuzzy and unclear information generated in the process of multi-sensor collaboration. Then, the analysis and recognition of multi-sensor fusion information using AI technology are analyzed in detail. This paper discusses the problems in multi-sensor information fusion and related solutions. Combined with the key nodes of 3D object AI feature recognition, multi-sensor collaborative Dempster Shafer evidence theory and 3D convolutional neural network waterfront space landscape feature recognition sub-model are constructed, and the waterfront space landscape recognition analysis model is tested and analyzed. The results show that the multi-sensor information collection Kalman filtering fusion algorithm effectively realizes the recognition of landscape feature information and the filtering of irrelevant interference information combined with an artificial intelligence algorithm to build a landscape feature recognition model. Among all kinds of landscape recognition, the recognition effect of beach inflow is the best, and the recognition accuracy, recall, and F1 value are all above 95. However, the identification effect of hydrophilic plank roads and underwater breakwater is relatively poor. The recognition accuracy of the hydrophilic platform is the lowest at 83.16 % among the eight landscape types, and the recall rate of underwater breakwater is the lowest at 79.96 % among the eight landscape types. In general, the multi-sensor Kalman filtering algorithm information fusion model designed in this paper has higher recognition accuracy and better classification performance for the collection and classification of the entire landscape dataset. The work of this paper provides a new idea and direction for the design and application of waterfront landscape identification and analysis systems based on intelligent sensors and artificial intelligence technology and lays a certain foundation for the intelligent design of urban waterfront landscapes. © 2024",Artificial intelligence feature recognition; Intelligent sensor; Multi-sensor information fusion; Recognition and classification of waterfront landscape features; Three-dimensional sensor information recognition; Waterfront landscape,Breakwaters; Convolutional neural networks; Information fusion; Kalman filters; Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Artificial intelligence feature recognition; Features recognition; Information recognition; Intelligent sensors; Landscape feature; Multi-sensor information fusion; Recognition and classification of waterfront landscape feature; Sensor informations; Three-dimensional sensor; Three-dimensional sensor information recognition; Waterfront landscape; Collaborative filtering,,,,,"(2021SJA0403); (2021–2024, NYXT2022016)","Research project of philosophy and social science in universities in Jiangsu Province (2021SJA0403), Research on the design of urban public reading space from the perspective of creating space vitality; Research project of Cultural creativity and collaborative innovation in universities in Jiangsu Province (2021\u20132024), (NYXT2022016), Design of community children's micro sports facilities from the perspective of promoting physical activity.","2019 International Conference on Organizational Innovation Icoi 2019, (2019); J Green Sci Technol, (2017); International Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research Ijair, (2022); Shi, Han, Systematic analysis of a military wearable device based on a multi-level fusion framework: Research directions, Sensors, 19, 12, (2019); Landsc Arch Aust, (2021); Gong, Yuming, A new multi-sensor fusion target recognition method based on complementarity analysis and neutrosophic set, Symmetry, 12, 9, (2020); Liu, Tianbi, A Novel Multi-Sensor Fusion Based Object Detection and Recognition Algorithm for Intelligent Assisted Driving, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 81564-81574, (2021); Lu, Liping, Datafusion method of multi-sensor target recognition in complex environment, Xi'an Dianzi Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Xidian University, 47, 4, pp. 31-38, (2020); Meng, Zeng, PINN-FORM: A new physics-informed neural network for reliability analysis with partial differential equation, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 414, (2023); Erdaş, Mehmet Umut, Optimum design of a seat bracket using artificial neural networks and dandelion optimization algorithm, Materialpruefung/Materials Testing, 65, 12, pp. 1767-1775, (2023)",,,Academic Press,,,,,,27729419,,,,English,Syst.

This field often entails extensive civic involvement and collaborative partnerships with institutions. Its overarching objectives span a spectrum from preserving water quality, habitat, and biodiversity to mitigating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. The UHI phenomenon, characterized by notably higher temperatures in urban areas compared to rural counterparts due to heat absorption by urban infrastructure and limited urban forest coverage, serves as a focal point in this study. The study focuses on developing a methodological framework that integrates Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Random Forest (RF), and Suitability Analysis to assess the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect across different urban zones, aiming to identify areas with varying levels of UHI impact. The framework is designed to assist urban planners and designers in understanding the spatial distribution of UHI and identifying areas where urban forestry initiatives can be strategically implemented to mitigate its effect. Conducted in various London areas, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of the intricate relationship between urban and community forestry and UHI. By mapping the spatial variability of UHI, the framework offers a novel approach to enhancing urban environmental design and advancing urban forestry studies.

However, getting high resolution multi-faceted data about a city has been a challenge. Further, even when the data were available the integration into a model is even more of a challenge due to the parametric needs, and the data volumes. Further, even if this is achieved, the cities themselves continually evolve rendering the data obsolete, thus necessitating a fast and repeatable data capture mechanism. We have shown that by using AI/graphics community advances we can create a seamless opportunity for high resolution models. Instead of assuming every physical and behavioral detail is sensed, a generative and procedural approach seeks to computationally infer a fully detailed 3D fit-for-purpose model of an urban space. We present a perspective building on recent success results of this generative approach applied to urban design and planning at different scales, for different components of the urban landscape, and related applications. The opportunities now possible with such a generative model for urban modeling open a wide range of opportunities as this becomes mainstream. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial intelligence; Generative AI; Urban computational science; Urban modeling,Climate models; Urban planning; Climate assessment; Climate simulation; Computational science; Data volume; Generative AI; High resolution; Numerical prediction models; Urban computational science; Urban modeling; Weather simulation; Artificial intelligence,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1835739, 1816514, 2106717, 2032770); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work has been funded by several US NSF grants including #1835739, #1816514, #2106717, and #2032770.","Bauer, Peter, A digital twin of Earth for the green transition, Nature Climate Change, 11, 2, pp. 80-83, (2021); Chen, Fei, The integrated WRF/urban modelling system: Development, evaluation, and applications to urban environmental problems, International Journal of Climatology, 31, 2, pp. 273-288, (2011); Ching, Jason K.S., WUDAPT: An urban weather, climate, and environmental modeling infrastructure for the anthropocene, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 99, 9, pp. 1907-1924, (2018); Cho, Adrian, At DOE, efforts to address climate and diversity dovetail, Science, 372, 6549, (2021); Estrada, F., A global economic assessment of city policies to reduce climate change impacts, Nature Climate Change, 7, 6, pp. 403-406, (2017); Firoze, Adnan M., Tree Instance Segmentation with Temporal Contour Graph, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2023-June, pp. 2193-2202, (2023); Firoze, Adnan M., Urban tree generator: spatio-temporal and generative deep learning for urban tree localization and modeling, Visual Computer, 38, 9-10, pp. 3327-3339, (2022); He, Liu, GlobalMapper: Arbitrary-Shaped Urban Layout Generation, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 454-464, (2023); He, Liu, Generative Building Feature Estimation From Satellite Images, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 61, (2023); Hu, Chenxi, Mega-city development impact on hourly extreme rainfall over the South China Greater Bay Area under near-future climate warming, Urban Climate, 48, (2023)","D.

In this study, we generated a 3 m high-resolution UBGG landscape dataset (UBGG-3m) for 36 Chinese metropolises using a transferable multi-scale high-resolution convolutional neural network and 336 Planet images. To train the network for generalization, we also created a large-volume UBGG landscape sample dataset (UBGGset) covering 2,272 km2 of urban landscape samples at 3 m resolution. The classification results for five cities across diverse geographic regions substantiate the superior accuracy of UBGG-3m in both visual interpretation and quantitative evaluation (with an overall accuracy of 91.2% and FWIoU of 83.9%).

In Singapore, domestic electricity usage in public residential buildings takes up a significant portion of the country's annual energy consumption. Having effective forecasting approaches is thus important in supporting relevant strategies and policy making. In this research, we proposed a hybrid approach that was based on a combination of building characteristics and urban landscape variables to predict residential housing electricity usage in Singapore. XGboost was also incorporated inside the hybrid approach as the preferred machine learning approach for energy consumption predictions. To demonstrate our proposed approach's predictive strength, the performance of our proposed hybrid machine learning approach was compared with two other models, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model and the Random Forest (RF) model. Results showed that our proposed hybrid model had outperformed these abovementioned approaches with higher accuracy (r2 value of 0.9). The proposed approach had thus been effective in forecasting electricity consumption for public housing in Singapore, and it could also be utilised in other similar urban areas for future electricity consumption forecasting. © The Author(s) 2023.",Electricity consumption; Geographically Weighted Regression; Hybrid machine learning approach; Random Forest; XGboost,Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Forestry; Housing; Machine learning; Random forests; Electricity usage; Electricity-consumption; Geographically weighted regression; Hybrid approach; Hybrid machine learning; Hybrid machine learning approach; Machine learning approaches; Singapore; Xgboost; Forecasting; electricity supply; energy efficiency; forecasting method; household energy; machine learning; regression analysis; Singapore [Southeast Asia],,,,,"National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (R-296-000-188-281); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF) Virtual Singapore Grant (R-296-000-188-281).","Nejat, Payam, A global review of energy consumption, CO2 emissions and policy in the residential sector (with an overview of the top ten CO2 emitting countries), Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 43, pp. 843-862, (2015); undefined, (2017); undefined, (2021); Wan, Kenny S.Y., Building design and energy end-use characteristics of high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong, Applied Energy, 78, 1, pp. 19-36, (2004); Pérez-Lombard, Luis, A review on buildings energy consumption information, Energy and Buildings, 40, 3, pp. 394-398, (2008); Jones, Rory V., The socio-economic, dwelling and appliance related factors affecting electricity consumption in domestic buildings, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 43, pp. 901-917, (2015); McLoughlin, Fintan, Characterising domestic electricity consumption patterns by dwelling and occupant socio-economic variables: An Irish case study, Energy and Buildings, 48, pp. 240-248, (2012); Sustainable Development Research, (2020); Chua, Kian Jon, Energy performance of residential buildings in Singapore, Energy, 35, 2, pp. 667-678, (2010); Wang, Ran, Multi-criteria comprehensive study on predictive algorithm of hourly heating energy consumption for residential buildings, Sustainable Cities and Society, 49, (2019)","K.

Thus, it is crucial to address risks concerns to achieve modernization of spatial management. Moreover, how to scientifically identify the risk pattern of territorial space and how to map and control it in space becomes a critical and urgent issue to be addressed for achieving modernization of spatial management. Understanding the intricate relationship between land use, environmental factors, and population density is essential for identifying risk patterns that can inform effective disaster management strategies. By employing advanced analytical methods, this study aims to provide a comprehensive framework for recognizing and mitigating territorial spatial risks in an increasingly complex urban landscape. This study used a case study to conduct the unsupervised algorithm of stack autoencoder self-organizing map to analyze the distribution and spatial clustering of Shenzhen's land spatial risk pattern and reveal the driving mechanism of its risk pattern formation in detail. It was found that: (1) The overall territorial spatial risk pattern of Shenzhen presents a distribution trend of “high in the west and low in the east, high in the south and low in the north”; that is, I and II risk areas are clustered in the hilly areas in the northeast and IV and V risk areas in the coastal areas in the southwest; (2) Population density, land use intensity, seawater intrusion, geological disasters, relief amplitude, soil type, soil erosion intensity are the main driving forces for the formation of Shenzhen's territorial spatial risk pattern. In particular, seawater intrusion, population density and land use intensity, soil type were found having significantly synergistic impact on the risk pattern. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning algorithm; Risk pattern identification; Spatial clustering analysis; Territorial space; Zoning control,Conformal mapping; Deep learning; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; Case-studies; Clustering analysis; Deep learning algorithm; Pattern identification; Population densities; Risk pattern identification; Spatial clustering; Spatial clustering analyze; Territorial space; Zoning control; Self organizing maps,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52278472); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (8232004); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality",National Natural Science Foundation of China (52278472) and Beijing Natural Science Foundation Project (8232004).,"Abascal, Ángela, Identifying degrees of deprivation from space using deep learning and morphological spatial analysis of deprived urban areas, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 95, (2022); Environ Res Lett, (2021); Anelli, Debora, Urban resilience against natural disasters: Mapping the risk with an innovative indicators-based assessment approach, Journal of Cleaner Production, 371, (2022); World Bank Urban Development Series, (2021); Asadzadeh, Asad, Capacitating urban governance and planning systems to drive transformative resilience, Sustainable Cities and Society, 96, (2023); Busayo, Emmanuel Tolulope, Recommendations for linking climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in urban coastal zones: Lessons from East London, South Africa, Ocean and Coastal Management, 203, (2021); Sustain Cities Soc, (2021); Fakhruddin, Bapon S.H.M., Extent and evaluation of vulnerability for disaster risk reduction of urban Nuku'alofa, Tonga, Progress in Disaster Science, 2, (2019); Fang, Jiayi, Benefits of subsidence control for coastal flooding in China, Nature Communications, 13, 1, (2022); Arab J Geosci, (2022)","D.

Urban expansion is altering the permeability of the land, thus increasing the risk of flooding. This study investigates the impact of urban morphology on pluvial floodwater distribution in 15 urban catchments across England, UK, to provide an analysis of how urban morphology influences flood magnitude. Using a cellular automata-based model, pluvial flood simulations were conducted for catchments characterized by diverse urban morphologies. Then a series of machine learning models were adopted to reveal the relationships between the morphological characteristics of urban configurations (e.g., building footprints, impervious surfaces, street network, topography) and pluvial flooding. These models were used to identify and quantify the effects of key urban morphological indicators on pluvial flooding. The results indicate that, although the total area of impervious surfaces plays the most significant role in floodwater distribution, the edge density (ED) of building footprints and impervious surfaces also influences this process. Synthetic experiments with an exemplary urban fabric show that decreasing “ED of building footprint” and increasing “ED of impervious surface” can mitigate flood volume by up to 6.3 % at 100 % drainage efficiency and 7.8 % at 50 % efficiency. The results of this study are anticipated to aid urban planners and policymakers in developing strategies for implementing flood-resilient cities. © 2024",Flood mitigation; Machine learning; Urban morphology; Urban pluvial floods,Catchments; Drainage; Runoff; Urban growth; Building footprint; Edge densities; Flood mitigation; Impervious surface; Machine-learning; Pluvial flooding; Pluvials; Urban catchment; Urban morphology; Urban pluvial flood; Climate change; catchment; cellular automaton; flood control; flood frequency; flooding; hazard assessment; machine learning; permeability; policy making; rainfall-runoff modeling; strategic approach; urban design; urban morphology; urban planning; article; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; controlled study; England; flood mitigation; human; morphological trait; morphology; rain; simulation; topography; United Kingdom,,,,,"National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; National University of Singapore, NUS; Nanyang Technological University, NTU; Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH; University of Exeter; Singapore University of Technology and Design, SUTD","This research was funded in part by the Future Cities Lab Global programme.

While numerous studies have examined the influence of urban form on solar potential, the optimization of solar energy use in cities located at high latitudes remains a challenging subject. In this study, we focus on the high-latitude city of Glasgow, using residential buildings in urban grid cells as our sample. We calculate solar potential and urban form indicators for these buildings using the Digimap database and the ArcGIS Pro platform. Employing eight machine learning algorithms, we analyze the data and extract eight key morphological indicators that affect the solar potential of urban grid cells. Among these indicators, we select four indicators—roof slope, building density, plot ratio, and building perimeter shape factor—for cluster analysis, enabling us to classify urban building forms into five types based on their characteristics and solar potential. Our calculations demonstrate that effective utilization of solar energy offers significant zero energy potential for Glasgow. The findings of this research can provide valuable guidance in the early stages of urban planning and design, assisting policymakers in rationalizing the use of solar energy resources for sustainable urban development. Furthermore, the results help urban stakeholders identify variations in the solar potential of different building forms, aiding them in selecting appropriate building types and zones to maximize solar energy utilization. © 2024 International Solar Energy Society",High latitude area; Machine learning algorithms; Urban design; Urban morphology; Urban solar potential,Learning algorithms; Solar energy; Energy; High latitude area; High Latitudes; Machine learning algorithms; Morphological indicator; Solar potential; Urban design; Urban form; Urban morphology; Urban solar potential; Cluster analysis; algorithm; altitude; ArcGIS; energy use; optimization; solar power; urban area; urban design; urban morphology; urban planning; Glasgow,,,,,"Wuhan University, WHU; University of Dundee",This study is supported by Wuhan University-Dundee University research collaboration.

Chemical transport models such as Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and Weather Research and Forecasting Modeling with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) provide fundamental insights into the behavior of atmospheric pollutants but face limitations in spatial resolution and prediction accuracy. Machine learning combined with low-cost sensors can improve prediction accuracy compared to numerical models, but uneven sensor distribution may result in biased prediction results. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative framework that leverages a quadtree space division to refine the numerical simulations of air pollutants into higher spatial resolutions by dynamically adjusting grid sizes based on the distribution of increased sensor deployments. Using a variable-resolution grid, the study first aggregates variables into a grid and then calculates spatial dependence based on grid cells. The deep-learning-based Time Series Transformer model is then used to perform detailed temporal predictions of PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration across the entire grid. The spatial and temporal modeling framework is designed to use the past 48 h' aggregated data, including meteorological variables from WRF-Chem numerical simulation and PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations from ground monitoring stations and sensors, to predict future 48-h’ PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations and tested across entire grids within Los Angeles County from January to June 2020. The results show that the performance of variable resolution grids is better than that of fixed grids regarding four metrics: minimum resolution, overall spatiotemporal RMSE, average bias, and prediction coverage. Among them, the variable resolution grids with up to 4 sensors showed the best performance, with an overall spatiotemporal RMSE of 1.12 μg/m3, which was about 40% lower than 2-sensor and 8-sensor variable resolution grids, a significant reduction of 55% compared to a 3 km fixed grid configuration. Future work will involve additional relevant factors such as emission sources and sinks to improve prediction accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollution; PM2.5; Timeseries prediction; Transformer neural network; Variable resolution grids,Distribution transformers; Prediction models; Urban transportation; Weather forecasting; Neural-networks; PM 2.5; Prediction accuracy; Quad trees; Series transformer; Time series prediction; Times series; Transformer neural network; Variable resolution; Variable resolution grid; Air quality; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; numerical model; particulate matter; public health; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; benchmarking; data aggregation; deep learning; forecasting; grid cell; machine learning; meteorology; model; monitoring; nerve cell network; nonhuman; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; quadtree division; root mean squared error; simulation; time series transformer; urban area; weather; weather research and forecasting modeling with chemistry,,,,,,,"Abdi-Oskouei, Maryam, Sensitivity of Meteorological Skill to Selection of WRF-Chem Physical Parameterizations and Impact on Ozone Prediction During the Lake Michigan Ozone Study (LMOS), Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 125, 5, (2020); Appel, K.

These cities leverage digital technologies to foster citizen engagement, collaborative decision-making and community-driven urban development, thus unlocking new potentials while confronting emerging threats. Such technologies are empowering individuals and organizations in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago. They do, however, introduce new risks and vulnerabilities that must be carefully managed. Hence, socio-technical innovation is urgently needed. In this connection, open-source technologies, participatory approaches and new forms of governance are becoming more popular and relevant. This theme issue looks into the tangible impacts of these technological advancements, with a focus on participatory cities. It aims to explain how digital tools are used in cities to tackle urban challenges, improve governance and promote sustainability. Through a collection of in-depth analyses, case studies and real-world examples, this issue seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of the digital governance frameworks underpinning participatory cities.

Owing to the population’s fluctuating needs, a new and dual perspective of urban space emerges. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) of a territory, or the system of technical diligence associated with the anthropocentric world, makes sense in the context of this temporal mismatch between territorial processes and utilitarian apparatus. This creates cerebral connections between several concurrent decision-making systems, leading to numerous perspectives of the same urban environment, often filtered by the people whose interests direct the information flow till the transformability. In contrast to the conventional methodologies of decision analysis, which are employed to facilitate convenient judgments between alternative options, innovative Artificial Intelligence tools are gaining traction as a means of more effectively evaluating and selecting fast-track solutions. The study’s goal is to investigate the cross-functional relationships between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and current decision-making support systems, which are increasingly being used to interpret urban growth and development from a multi-dimensional perspective, such as a multi-criteria one. Individuals in charge of administering and governing a territory will gain from artificial intelligence techniques because they will be able to test resilience and responsibility in decision-making circumstances while also responding fast and spontaneously to community requirements. The study evaluates current grading techniques and recommends areas for future upgrades via the lens of the potentials afforded by AI technology to the establishment of digitization pathways for technological advancements in the urban valuation. © 2024 by the authors.",AI; MCDA; scoping review; urban environment,Brain computer interface; Decision making; Decision support systems; 'current; Decision-making process; Intelligence integration; Landscape changes; MCDA; Multicriteria analysis; Process convergence; Scoping review; Urban environments; Urban landscape; Urban growth,,,,,,,"Nyholm, Sven R., Meaning in Life in AI Ethics—Some Trends and Perspectives, Philosophy and Technology, 36, 2, (2023); Furman, Jason, AI and the economy, Innovation Policy and the Economy, 19, 1, pp. 161-191, (2019); Fosso Wamba, Samuel, Industry experiences of artificial intelligence (AI): benefits and challenges in operations and supply chain management, Production Planning and Control, 33, 16, pp. 1493-1497, (2022); Robbins, Scott A., Our New Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure: Becoming Locked into an Unsustainable Future, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 8, (2022); Bell, Samuel J., Modeling the Machine Learning Multiverse, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, (2022); Peng, Zhongren, The Pathway of Urban Planning AI: From Planning Support to Plan-Making, Journal of Planning Education and Research, 44, 4, pp. 2263-2279, (2024); Danziger, Shai, Extraneous factors in judicial decisions, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108, 17, pp. 6889-6892, (2011); Human Machine Reimagining Work in the Age of AI, (2018); Mahroof, Kamran, A human-centric perspective exploring the readiness towards smart warehousing: The case of a large retail distribution warehouse, International Journal of Information Management, 45, pp. 176-190, (2019); Horvitz, Eric J., Decision theory in expert systems and artificial intelligence, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 2, 3, pp. 247-302, (1988)","F.

This study selected nine representative modern gardens in the Taihu Lake region as samples. Utilizing machine learning techniques combined with image semantic segmentation and principal component analysis, it systematically assessed various microscopic features of gardens and explored their relationship with actual visitor experience ratings. The aim is to reveal emotional resonance and aesthetic preferences during the touring process. The results indicate: (1) Comfort holds a primary position in influencing visitor touring experiences; (2) Microscopic features such as water features, tall vegetation, architecture, and ornametal elements significantly contribute to visitor comfort; (3) The random forest model unveils complex interactions between microscopic features and the overall visitor experience, indicating limitations in traditional linear model evaluations for such relationships. Through analyzing the relationship between microscopic garden features and visitor experiences in the selected cases, this study highlights the importance of adopting non-linear models to optimize garden landscape design and enhance the visitor touring experience. © 2024 The Author(s).

Hence, this study aims to quantify spatio-temporal trajectories of urban growth in Asansol City during 1991–2021, using integrated remote sensing and GIS-based techniques. Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI/TIRS satellite imageries were used to delineate built-up and non-built-up areas using a random forest machine-learning algorithm. The study utilized the gradient approach, urban sprawl typologies, urban expansion indices, shannon's entropy, and landscape fragmentation metrics to analyze the pattern, direction, intensity and dynamics of urban expansion in a space-time context. The findings showed that built-up growth increased significantly from 25.49 sq. km. to 57.18 sq. km. between 1991 and 2021, with the highest growth observed in the westward direction and within 3 km from the CBD. The study highlighted the prevalence of edge expansion and scatter development as dominant typologies of urban growth. Urban expansion indices, shannon's entropy and landscape fragmentation metrics analysis revealed the increasing urban sprawl towards the periphery and the formation of clustered built-up areas near the CBD.

Therefore, optimizing urban block design in the early stages contributes to enhancing urban energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. However, widely used multi-objective optimization methods based on performance simulation face the challenges of high computational loads and low efficiency. This study introduces a framework using machine learning, especially the XGBoost model, to accelerate multi-objective optimization of energy-efficient urban block forms. A residential block in Nanjing serves as the case study. The framework commences with a parametric block form model driven by design variables, focusing on minimizing building energy consumption (EUI), maximizing photovoltaic energy generation (PVE) and outdoor sunlight hours (SH). Data generated through Latin Hypercube Sampling and performance simulations inform the model training. Through training and hyperparameter tuning, XGBoost’s predictive accuracy was validated against artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) models. Subsequently, XGBoost replaced traditional performance simulations, conducting multi-objective optimization via the NSGA-II algorithm. Results showcase the framework’s significant acceleration of the optimization process, improving computational efficiency by over 420 times and producing 185 Pareto optimal solutions with improved performance metrics. SHAP analysis highlighted shape factor (SF), building density (BD), and building orientation (BO) as key morphological parameters influencing EUI, PVE, and SH.

Thirty experts in architecture and urban planning made up its statistical population. A combination of artificial intelligence algorithms, tree data mining techniques, and the FTOPSIS multi-criteria decision analysis method have been applied to the information analysis process. A panel of experts was formed to gather information, and the criteria of housing design that had evolved in the post-corona period were identified by designing a questionnaire on the Likert scale (i.e., a psychometric scale named after its inventor)—the primary influential factors in the pattern of housing architecture after the Corona period were determined. The findings showed a significant correlation between housing architecture in the post-corona period and people's health patterns. Results showed that the factors that have the most significant impact on the evolution of housing in the region under investigation include the new function of housing (0.152), changing behavioral interactions (0.152), design criteria (0.145) and the passive ventilation factor with a score of 0.113. Other results showed that the physical distance as well as quarantine and isolation components obtained a score of 0.359 and 0.328, respectively, and were identified as the most critical developments in housing architecture. Finally, data mining findings showed that the spatial quality variable in the first phase had the most significant influence on the growth and fortification of the evolution of housing components at the study area level and the promotion of the health of people in the community in the post-pandemic period. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Architectural design; COVID-19 pandemic mitigation; House design; Hybrid methods,Analysis method; Analytical approach; Artificial intelligence algorithms; COVID-19 pandemic mitigation; Data-mining techniques; House design; Housing architecture; Hybrid method; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Tree data; architectural design; COVID-19; housing; public health; urban design,,,,,"Department of Education of Guangdong Province, DEGP, (2021KTSCX004); Department of Education of Guangdong Province, DEGP; (2021-K2-305243); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2023A1515011137, 2024A1515012129, 2024A04J9930); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province; (2024ZB06); (GD22XGL02)","This research is supported by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (grant no. 2024A1515012129 and grant no. 2023A1515011137); State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building and Urban Science, South China University of Technology (grant no. 2024ZB06); the 2022 Guangdong Philosophy and Social Science Foundation (grant no.

Fine-grained LCZ mapping considering spatial and temporal heterogeneity can provide a more precise characterization of surface thermal properties, thereby enabling a comprehensive analysis and understanding of spatiotemporal trends in climate change research. However, data-driven deep learning-based methods have limitations in coping with the complex urban landscapes of the real-world scenarios, including the spectral similarity of different LCZ and the geospatial heterogeneity of urban LCZ categories. In this study, we constructed a geographic knowledge base for enhanced LCZ characterization with the consideration of prior surface spatial information, including a set of spectral indices and urban morphological parameters (UMPs). Then, we integrated the explicable geographic knowledge base into a learnable deep learning framework in an end-to-end manner for accurate LCZ mapping by fusing multi-source heterogeneous data with a multi-level fusion strategy. The constructed Chinese Climate Zone Time Series LCZ (CClimate-TLCZ) dataset derived from Landsat-8 data with a 30 m spatial resolution, covering 18 representative cities in China, were used to evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieved optimal outcomes across 18 cities, with an average overall accuracy exceeding 94 %, which is more than 20 % higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Furthermore, the analysis of LCZ mapping-driven land surface temperature (LST) and surface UHI (SUHI) applications shows that cities within the same climate zone have similar LST distribution patterns, while significant heterogeneity exist between different zones. The annual consistency of LST patterns within each climate zone supports the validity of the LCZ classification scheme and accurate LCZ mapping for urban thermal environment studies. From 2016 to 2022, SUHI intensity initially increases and then decreases, indicating improvements in the urban thermal environment. These findings underscore the critical role of precise LCZ mapping in urban climate resilience and sustainable urban planning. © 2024 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Through the development and application of a LUR-based Bayesian Network (BN) model to detailed, mobile-based BC measurements, we have successfully decoded the causal relationships and conditional probabilities linking diverse urban land use variables to BC levels. The BN model demonstrates notable prediction accuracy on the test set, with an R2 of 0.59 and an NRMSE of 0.65. Among the varied land use variables analyzed, proximity to the port is identified as the dominant factor contributing to BC hotspots. Moreover, the synergistic effect of port proximity and truck routes emerges as a key driver of spatially clustered BC hotspots, a complex phenomenon not adequately captured by conventional machine learning and deep learning models. The insights revealed through this study are vital not just for enhancing air pollution prediction and exposure analysis but also for informing urban planning and policymaking, offering valuable, actionable insights. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollution prediction; Bayesian network model; Black carbon; Explainable machine learning; Land use,Air pollution; Bayesian networks; Carbon; Complex networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Air pollution predictions; Bayesian network models; Black carbon; Carbon concentrations; Explainable machine learning; Hotspots; Land-use regression models; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Urban landscape; Land use; black carbon; accuracy assessment; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; land use; machine learning; prediction; urban area; urban planning; air pollution; analytic method; Article; Bayesian network; built environment; city planning; controlled study; cross validation; decision making; deep learning; highway; histogram; human; measurement accuracy; pollution exposure,,,,,"European Defence Fund, EDF","Apte et al. (2017) developed and applied a sophisticated data reduction and aggregation algorithm to transform these instantaneous observations into estimates of median annual weekday concentrations for each 30-m segment of road within the study area. Our research focuses on the subset of these aggregated annual median BC concentration values, which are depicted in Fig. 1. We have more than 5500 segments of 30 m roadway, each with a BC annual median concentration. The weekday annual median BC concentration dataset is available from both Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) website (EDF, 2024) and Apte et al. (2017) supporting information.Building on the approach from Tang et al. (2023), we utilized the same 45 features selected from the initial 108 variables, through a Genetic Algorithm (GA), as detailed in Section S1 of the supporting information. The GA method effectively narrowed down the most influential variables and multi-collinearity issues, thereby reducing the complexity of our BN model and enhancing the interpretability of the results. In conclusion, this study constructs a hybrid LUR model through the integration of land use variables with a BN model. The BN model serves as the regression mechanism for the conventional LUR model. Moreover, the interpretability of the BN model elucidates the influence of land use variables on BC concentrations within complex urban landscapes.Fig. 4 visualizes the correlations between land use variables and log-transformed BC concentrations. It also supports our expert knowledge and assumptions in creating the DAG for BN model construction. All the land use variables show relatively significant (correlation coefficient with absolute value greater than 0.5) correlations with BC concentrations, suggesting their dependencies. The same land use variables with different buffer scales are also highly correlated, while different land use variables are less correlated.In the Supporting Information section S2, we have detailed the model coefficients for our fully trained BN model. Utilizing this model, we can investigate the relative importance and conditional probabilities of different land use variables in influencing BC concentrations.","Ademujimi, Toyosi, Model-Driven Bayesian Network Learning for Factory-Level Fault Diagnostics and Resilience, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 2, (2024); Apte, Joshua S., Ambient PM2.5 Reduces Global and Regional Life Expectancy, Environmental Science and Technology Letters, 5, 9, pp. 546-551, (2018); Apte, Joshua S., High-Resolution Air Pollution Mapping with Google Street View Cars: Exploiting Big Data, Environmental Science and Technology, 51, 12, pp. 6999-7008, (2017); Borna, Mehrdad, Evaluating the Influence of Urban Blocks on Air Pollution Concentration Levels: The Case Study of Golden Lane Estate in London, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 2, (2024); Rodríguez Núñez, Martín, Quantifying the contribution of environmental variables to cyclists’ exposure to PM2.5 using machine learning techniques, Heliyon, 10, 2, (2024); Cohen, Aaron J., Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015, The Lancet, 389, 10082, pp. 1907-1918, (2017); Gupta, Aman, A systematic review on urban blue-green infrastructure in the south Asian region: recent advancements, applications, and challenges, Water Science and Technology, 89, 2, pp. 382-403, (2024); Di, Qian, An ensemble-based model of PM2.5 concentration across the contiguous United States with high spatiotemporal resolution, Environment International, 130, (2019); Di, Qian, Assessing PM2.5 Exposures with High Spatiotemporal Resolution across the Continental United States, Environmental Science and Technology, 50, 9, pp. 4712-4721, (2016); Environ Def Fund, (2024)","X.

A comprehensive assessment of urban landscapes is crucial for guiding the development of inclusive, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements. Previous studies have primarily analyzed two-dimensional landscape indicators derived from satellite remote sensing, potentially overlooking the valuable insights provided by the three-dimensional configuration of landscapes. This limitation arises from the high cost of acquiring large-area three-dimensional data and the lack of effective assessment indicators. Here, we propose four urban landscapes indicators in three dimensions (UL3D): greenness, grayness, openness, and crowding. We construct the UL3D using 4.03 million street view images from 303 major cities in China, employing a deep learning approach. We combine urban background and two-dimensional urban landscape indicators with UL3D to predict the socioeconomic profiles of cities. The results show that UL3D indicators differs from two-dimensional landscape indicators, with a low average correlation coefficient of 0.31 between them. Urban landscapes had a changing point in 2018–2019 due to new urbanization initiatives, with grayness and crowding rates slowing, while openness increased. The incorporation of UL3D indicators significantly enhances the explanatory power of the regression model for predicting socioeconomic profiles. Specifically, GDP per capita, urban population rate, built-up area per capita, and hospital count correspond to improvements of 25.0%, 19.8%, 35.5%, and 19.2%, respectively. These findings indicate that UL3D indicators have the potential to reflect the socioeconomic profiles of cities. © 2024 Science China Press",Deep learning; Landscape pattern; Street view images; Three-dimensional landscape indicators,Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Comprehensive assessment; Deep learning; Landscape indicators; Landscape pattern; Per capita; Socio-economics; Street view image; Three-dimensional landscape indicator; Two-dimensional; Urban landscape,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFF1303101); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC",This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFF1303101).,"Liu, Yansui, Regularity of rural settlement changes driven by rapid urbanization in North China over the three decades, Science Bulletin, 68, 18, pp. 2115-2124, (2023); Ye, Chao, Rural-urban co-governance: multi-scale practice, Science Bulletin, 65, 10, pp. 778-780, (2020); Wu, Shengbiao, Improved human greenspace exposure equality during 21st century urbanization, Nature Communications, 14, 1, (2023); Leng, Song, Diverse types of coupling trends in urban tree and nontree vegetation associated with urbanization levels, npj Urban Sustainability, 3, 1, (2023); Ye, Chao, The historical logics and geographical patterns of rural-urban governance in China, Journal of Geographical Sciences, 32, 7, pp. 1225-1240, (2022); Huang, Jinchuan, Spatiotemporal characteristics and driving mechanism of the coupling coordination degree of urbanization and ecological environment in Kazakhstan, Journal of Geographical Sciences, 30, 11, pp. 1802-1824, (2020); Lu, Yutian, An approach to urban landscape character assessment: Linking urban big data and machine learning, Sustainable Cities and Society, 83, (2022); Bai, Xuemei, Landscape urbanization and economic growth in China: Positive feedbacks and sustainability dilemmas, Environmental Science and Technology, 46, 1, pp. 132-139, (2012); Fan, Zhuangyuan, Urban visual intelligence: Uncovering hidden city profiles with street view images, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 120, 27, (2023); Salvati, Luca, Do spatial patterns of urbanization and land consumption reflect different socioeconomic contexts in Europe?, Science of the Total Environment, 625, pp. 722-730, (2018)","R.

Rapid urbanization and an increase in real estate developments have led to the erosion of unique urban landscape features. However, mountain cities boast distinctive terrain and landscapes, endowing them with a wealth of scenic resources and aesthetic appeal. Residents' growing concern for their living environment's quality and scenic beauty impacts property values during urban development. Mountain landscapes, vital natural elements of mountain cities, are studied less in their effect on housing prices compared to water features and urban greenery, despite their unique appeal to residents. This study integrates various sources of urban data with subjective analysis of human behavior and the multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) to assess the factors affecting housing prices in mountain cities. It examines the spatial distribution and influence of street view elements on property values and uses gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to analyze visual perception characteristics of street views.

This study proposes a deep learning model to classify 15-cm aerial imagery of urban landscapes, coupled with a vector-oriented post-classification processing algorithm for automatically retrieving canopy-covered impervious surfaces. In a case study in Corpus Christi, TX, deep learning classification covered an area of approximately 312 km2 (or 14.86 billion 0.15-m pixels), and the post-classification effort led to the retrieval of over 4 km2 (or 0.18 billion pixels) of additional impervious area. The results also suggest the underestimation of urban impervious area by existing methods that cannot consider the canopy-covered impervious surfaces. By improving the identification and quantification of various impervious surfaces at the city scale, this study could directly benefit a variety of environmental and infrastructure management practices and enhance the reliability and accuracy of processed-based models for urban hydrology and water infrastructure. © 2024 The Author(s).

This present study focuses on the Lixia District of Jinan City. By using urban street view big data and deep learning methods, we undertook a detailed analysis of the impacts of urban color features on residents’ emotional perceptions. In particular, a substantial corpus of street scene image data was extracted and processed. This was performed using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and semantic segmentation technology (PSPNet), which enabled the simulation and prediction of the subjective perception of the urban environment by humans. Furthermore, the color complexity and coordination in the street scene were quantified and combined with residents’ emotional feedback to carry out a multi-dimensional analysis. The findings revealed that color complexity and coordination were significant elements influencing residents’ emotional perceptions. A high color complexity is visually appealing, but can lead to fatigue, discomfort, and boredom; a moderate complexity stimulates vitality and pleasure; high levels of regional harmony and aesthetics can increase perceptions of beauty and security; and low levels of coordination can increase feelings of depression. The environmental characteristics of different areas and differences in the daily activities of residents resulted in regional differences regarding the impacts of color features on emotional perception. This study corroborates the assertion that environmental color coordination has the capacity to enhance residents’ emotions, thereby providing an important reference point for urban planning. Planning should be based on the functional characteristics of the region, and color complexity and coordination should be reasonably regulated to optimize the emotional experiences of residents. Differentiated color management enhances urban aesthetics, livability, and residents’ happiness and promotes sustainable development. In the future, the influences of color and environmental factors on emotions can be explored in depth, with a view to assist in the formulation of fine urban design. © 2024 by the authors.",color features; deep convolutional neural network; emotion perception; random forest; urban streetscape,Color vision; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Emotion Recognition; Semantic Segmentation; Color complexity; Color coordination; Color features; Colour perception; Convolutional neural network; Emotion perception; Random forests; Urban colours; Urban environments; Urban streetscape; Convolutional neural networks,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41801308); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41801308.","Chen, Chongxian, Predicting the effect of street environment on residents' mood states in large urban areas using machine learning and street view images, Science of the Total Environment, 816, (2022); Beenackers, Mariëlle A., Urban densification in the Netherlands and its impact on mental health: An expert-based causal loop diagram, Health and Place, 87, (2024); Ma, Xiangyuan, Measuring human perceptions of streetscapes to better inform urban renewal: A perspective of scene semantic parsing, Cities, 110, (2021); Ieri Procedia, (2014); Ding, Meichen, Quantitative contrast of urban agglomeration colors based on image clustering algorithm: Case study of the Xia-Zhang-Quan metropolitan area, Frontiers of Architectural Research, 10, 3, pp. 692-700, (2021); Rui, Quanquan, Quantifying the spatial quality of urban streets with open street view images: A case study of the main urban area of Fuzhou, Ecological Indicators, 156, (2023); Rang, Wei, A unified hybrid memory system for scalable deep learning and big data applications, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 186, (2024); Fu, Leiming, An innovative decision making method for air quality monitoring based on big data-assisted artificial intelligence technique, Journal of Innovation and Knowledge, 8, 2, (2023); Lindal, Pall J., Architectural variation, building height, and the restorative quality of urban residential streetscapes, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 33, pp. 26-36, (2013); Subiza-Pérez, Mikel, Green and blue settings as providers of mental health ecosystem services: Comparing urban beaches and parks and building a predictive model of psychological restoration, Landscape and Urban Planning, 204, (2020)","P.

Previous studies have been limited in regard to the large-scale spatial identification of RPs due to the vagueness of boundaries and the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools. Furthermore, human perception of these places remains unclear. To address this gap, this research adopts a novel approach to identify and evaluate the RPs of a city from the perspective of human perception. Our methodology involves the utilization of deep learning systems, text semantic analysis, and other techniques to integrate multi-source data, including points of interest (POIs), street view images, and social media data. Taking Nanjing, China, as a case, we identified 192 RPs and their perceptual ranges (PRRPs). The results show the following: (1) Comparing RPs to non-RPs, RPs show higher average scores across four perceptual dimensions (positive indicators): Beautiful (7.11% higher), Lively (34.23% higher), Safety (28.42% higher), and Wealthy (28.26% higher). Conversely, RPs exhibit lower average scores in two perceptual dimensions (negative indicators): Boring (79.04% lower) and Depressing (20.35% lower). (2) Across various perceptual dimensions, RPs have utilized 15.13% of the land area to effectively cover approximately 50% of human perceptual hotspots and cold spots. (3) The RPs exhibit significant variations across different types, levels, and human preferences. These results demonstrate the positive perceived effects that RPs have, providing valuable insights to support urban management, the transformation of the built environment, and the promotion of sustainable urban development, and provide guidance for urban planners and designers to make improvements in urban design and planning to make these sites more attractive. © 2024 by the authors.",human perception; identification and evaluation; points of interest; Representative places (RPs); social media check-ins; street view images,identification method; image; machine learning; perception; social media; spatial analysis,,,,,"(SJCX23_0032); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51978144, 52378046); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was financially supported by Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. SJCX23_0032) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51978144, 52378046).

This trend poses a significant threat to the safety and property of urban residents and severely impedes the advancement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study proposed an integrated urban flooding risk analysis framework to provide an essential basis for developing effective adaptation and mitigation measures. The kernel density estimation was adopted to analyze the distribution characteristics of urban flooding hotspots. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was adopted for urban flooding risk probability assessment based on multi-source data. This study conducted an in-depth analysis from three perspectives including spatial analysis, risk planning and model comparison. The MaxEnt model and multiple exploratory spatial data analysis methods were combined to reveal spatial distribution patterns at grid cell scale. The MaxEnt and Zonation models were coupled to generate an urban flooding risk map. Further, six traditional machine learning models were compared with the MaxEnt model. The results indicate that rapid urbanization and intense human activities have significantly increased the number of buildings, leading to loss of previously existing blue and green spaces. These urban characteristics increase the vulnerability of cities to extreme rainfall. Compared to traditional machine learning models, the MaxEnt model has significant advantages. In the field of urban flooding risk, the MaxEnt model demonstrates significant potential for practical application. In summary, the framework empowers urban managers to comprehensively evaluate flooding risk in planning, supporting urban design and risk prevention. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Machine learning; Maximum entropy; Risk distribution; Space pattern; Urban flooding risk,,,,,,"(2024slkj-08); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52209034, 52209035); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; (21JT028, 21JT032); Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project, (2024SF-YBXM-655); Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project",Funding text 1: This work is partly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52209035); Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2024SF-YBXM-655); Shaanxi Water Conservancy Science and Technology Program (Grant No. 2024slkj-08); Key Scientific Research Program of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (Grant No. 21JT028 & 21JT032).; Funding text 2: This work is partly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52209034); Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2024SF-YBXM-655); Shaanxi Water Conservancy Science and Technology Program (Grant No. 2024slkj-08); Key Scientific Research Program of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (Grant No. 21JT028 & 21JT032).,"Guo, Yuchen, Construction of rapid early warning and comprehensive analysis models for urban waterlogging based on AutoML and comparison of the other three machine learning algorithms, Journal of Hydrology, 605, (2022); Yin, Jie, Modelling the impact of land subsidence on urban pluvial flooding: A case study of downtown Shanghai, China, Science of the Total Environment, 544, pp. 744-753, (2016); Xiao, Shuai, Assessment of the urban waterlogging resilience and identification of its driving factors: A case study of Wuhan City, China, Science of the Total Environment, 866, (2023); Liu, Yating, Economic loss of urban waterlogging based on an integrated drainage model and network environ analyses, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 192, (2023); Wang, Jia, Matching analysis of investment structure and urban inundation control function of sponge cities in China, Journal of Cleaner Production, 266, (2020); Qi, Xiaotian, Assessing the urban road waterlogging risk to propose relative mitigation measures, Science of the Total Environment, 849, (2022); da Silva, Lucas Borges Leal, A novel spatiotemporal multi-attribute method for assessing flood risks in urban spaces under climate change and demographic scenarios, Sustainable Cities and Society, 76, (2022); Yang, Kexin, Future urban waterlogging simulation based on LULC forecast model: A case study in Haining City, China, Sustainable Cities and Society, 87, (2022); Climate Change 2021 the Physical Science Basis Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2021); Huang, Huabing, The changing pattern of urban flooding in Guangzhou, China, Science of the Total Environment, 622-623, pp. 394-401, (2018)","R.

The study investigates how AI-driven urban planning tools can be applied to create more sustainable, efficient, and functional urban environments. PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> show high concentrations with peaks between 2014 and 2017, indicating simple pollution actions. Post-2017, there is a noticeable decline in pollution levels, possibly due to improved regulations or the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific years, like 2016, show extreme spikes, possibly due to industrial activities or natural events. The overall trend suggests improved air quality and moderate to strong positive correlations exist between PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf>, NO<inf>2</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, and CO, indicating shared bases or co-occurrence. However, there is no significant correlation between PM<inf>2.5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf>, suggesting different bases and behaviors. Bi-directional causality is observed between PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and SO<inf>2</inf>, and PM<inf>2.5</inf> and CO. This mutual cause suggests interrelated impressive processes and shared bases. The results of the causality analysis suggest the existence of complex interactions, where high levels of pollution can predict changes in others.

The process of generating a wind field prediction at pedestrian level is reformulated from a 3D CFD simulation into a 2D image-to-image translation task, using the projected building heights as input. Testing on standard consumer hardware shows that our model can efficiently predict wind velocities in urban settings in less than 1 ms. Further tests on different configurations of the model, combined with a Pareto front analysis, helped identify the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. The fastest configuration is close to seven times faster, while having a relative loss, which is 1.8 times higher than the most accurate configuration. This CNN-based approach provides a fast and efficient method for pedestrian wind comfort (PWC) analysis, potentially aiding in more efficient urban design processes. © 2024 The Author(s).

Residents’ satisfaction with the current urban environment is closely related to the landscape characteristics of the towns surrounding the historic center of Macau. This study aims to analyze the relationship between landscape characteristics and residents’ satisfaction, determine the key factors affecting their satisfaction and how they are combined, and provide a scientific basis for urban planning. This study used a decision tree machine learning model to analyze 524 questionnaire survey responses that addressed five aspects of the historic town’s landscape: the architectural, Largo Square, street, mountain and sea, and commercial landscapes. The data-driven approach helped find the best decision path. The results indicate that (1) the layout of Largo Square, the commercial colors and materials, the location of the former humanities and religion center, and the commercial signage system are the primary factors influencing residents’ satisfaction. (2) Incorporating decision tree parameters with information entropy as the splitting criterion and a minimum sample split number of two (with no maximum depth) led to the best performance when investigating residents’ satisfaction with Macau’s historic town landscape characteristics. (3) A reasonable layout for Largo Square (satisfaction > 3.50), prominent and harmonious commercial colors and materials (satisfaction > 3.50), rich cultural and religious elements (satisfaction > 4.50), and an excellent commercial signage system (satisfaction > 4.00) can significantly improve residents’ satisfaction. This provides important empirical support and a reference for urban planning and landscape design in Macau and other historical and cultural cities. © 2024 by the authors.",decision tree; historic built environment; historic urban landscape; machine learning; satisfaction questionnaire analysis; townscape characteristics; world heritage,Decision trees; Historic preservation; Urban planning; Built environment; Historic build environment; Historic centres; Historic urban landscape; Landscape characteristic; Machine-learning; Satisfaction questionnaire analyze; Townscape characteristic; Urban landscape; World heritage; Adversarial machine learning,,,,,,,"Zandonai, Sheyla S., The portuguese calçada in macau: Paving residual colonialism with a new cultural history of place, Current Anthropology, 59, 4, pp. 378-396, (2018); Mirror of Modernity the Post War Revolution in Urban Conservation, (2009); Vong, Tze Ngai Louis, Exploring Critical Factors of Macau's Heritage Tourism: What Heritage Tourists are Looking for when Visiting the City's Iconic Heritage Sites, Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research, 17, 3, pp. 231-245, (2012); Journal of Current Chinese Affairs, (2009); Bandarin, Francesco, The Historic Urban Landscape: Managing Heritage in an Urban Century, (2012); Asian Geographer, (2010); Asian Affairs, (1993); Chu, Cecilia L., Spectacular Macau: Visioning futures for a World Heritage City, Geoforum, 65, pp. 440-450, (2015); Porter, Jonathan, The past is present"":The construction of macau's historical legacy, History and Memory, 21, 1, pp. 63-100, (2009); Romanian Journal of Comparative Law, (2017)","Y.

Previous studies have mostly focused on the two-dimensional level of urban socio-economic activities, urban land use changes, and urban morphology, neglecting the importance of the three-dimensional spatial structure of cities. This study takes 30 cities in East China as an example. By using urban building data and carbon emission datasets, four machine learning algorithms, BP, RF, CNN, and CNN-RF, are established to build a CO<inf>2</inf> emission prediction model based on three-dimensional spatial structure, and the main influencing factors are further studied. The results show that the CNN-RF model performed optimally in both the testing and validation phases, with the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 0.85, 0.82; 10.60, 22.32; and 2.53, 1.92, respectively. Meanwhile, in the study unit, S, V, NHB, AN, BCR, SCD, and FAR have a greater impact on CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. This indicates a strong correlation between urban three-dimensional spatial structure and carbon emissions. The CNN-RF model can effectively evaluate the relationship between them, providing strategic support for spatial optimization of low-carbon cities. © 2024 by the authors.",CO2 emissions; low-carbon cities; machine learning; three-dimensional spatial structure; urban design,agglomeration; carbon emission; emission control; environmental modeling; land use change; machine learning; optimization; prediction; socioeconomic impact; spatial analysis; three-dimensional modeling; urban design; China,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42277075); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; (GXXT-2019-047, HYB20220186); (2023AH050187); (2208085US14)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42277075), Anhui Natural Science Research Foundation (2208085US14), Anhui University Collaborative Innovation Fund (GXXT-2019-047, HYB20220186), and Natural Science Foundation of colleges and universities in Anhui Province (2023AH050187).","Silva, Mafalda C., Urban Form and Energy Demand: A Review of Energy-relevant Urban Attributes, Journal of Planning Literature, 32, 4, pp. 346-365, (2017); Cai, Bofeng, China high resolution emission database (CHRED) with point emission sources, gridded emission data, and supplementary socioeconomic data, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 129, pp. 232-239, (2018); Wang, Shaojian, China's city-level energy-related CO2 emissions: Spatiotemporal patterns and driving forces, Applied Energy, 200, pp. 204-214, (2017); Wang, Shaojian, Examining the impacts of socioeconomic factors, urban form, and transportation networks on CO2 emissions in China's megacities, Applied Energy, 185, pp. 189-200, (2017); Wakiyama, Takako, The impact of electricity market reform and subnational climate policy on carbon dioxide emissions across the United States: A path analysis, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 149, (2021); Fan, Tianhui, Policy Driven Compact Cities: Toward Clarifying the Effect of Compact Cities on Carbon Emissions, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 19, (2022); Ribeiro, Haroldo Valentin, Effects of changing population or density on urban carbon dioxide emissions, Nature Communications, 10, 1, (2019); Domon, Shohei, The long-run effects of congestion tolls, carbon tax, and land use regulations on urban CO2 emissions, Regional Science and Urban Economics, 92, (2022); Tang, Jianxin, Scenario analysis of transportation carbon emissions in China based on machine learning and deep neural network models, Environmental Research Letters, 18, 6, (2023); Luna, Tiago Ferrari, The influence of e-carsharing schemes on electric vehicle adoption and carbon emissions: An emerging economy study, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 79, (2020)","B.

However, understanding their physical features in detail via remote sensing remains challenging due to the small and complex area characteristics. Advanced approaches struggle with the requirement for extensive training datasets, which are difficult to obtain and potentially inaccurate in certain settings. Sparse sampling of training data may offer a solution to these challenges, but its inability to consider useful contextual characteristics from objects remains as a significant barrier. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative methodology utilizing the Multivariate Long Short Term Memory–Fully Convolutional Network (MLSTM-FCN). This approach is adept at capturing subtle temporal and spectral variations from sparsely annotated data, making it particularly suited for optical remote sensing in urban POS. Our novel approach has achieved 97.86% accuracy in classifying POS features into 11 classes using only 1,870 annotated sample points and maintained over 90% of accuracy even with 187 samples or 10% of total samples, significantly outperform comparison models.

Compared to standard computer vision, satellite imagery is unique as images sampled from the data form a continuous array, rather than being fully independent. We argue that the spatial configuration of the images is as important as the content of each image when attempting to capture a pattern that reflects the structure of the urban environment. We propose a series of approaches explicitly incorporating spatial dimension in the predictive pipeline based on the EfficientNetB4 convolutional neural network (CNN) and experimentally test their effect on model performance. The experiments in this study cover the scale of the sampled area, the effect of spatial augmentation, and the role of modelling (logit ensemble and histogram-based gradient-boosted classifiers) with and without the spatial context on the outputs of the neural network-generated vector of probabilities while trying to predict spatial signatures, a classification of primarily urban landscape based on form and function. The results suggest that certain ways of embedding spatial information, especially in the modelling step, consistently significantly improve the prediction accuracy and shall be considered on top of standard CNNs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Classification; Open data; Remote sensing; Spatial signatures,Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Large datasets; Open Data; Satellite imagery; Convolutional neural network; Open datum; Remote-sensing; Spatial configuration; Spatial dimension; Spatial signature; Spatially explicit; Urban environments; Urban form; Urban landscape; Remote sensing; accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; classification; histogram; landscape structure; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial analysis; urban area,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/T005238/1)","The authors kindly acknowledge funding by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council through the project \u201CLearning an urban grammar from satellite data through AI\u201D, project reference ES/T005238/1.","Arribas-Bel, Daniel, Understanding (urban) spaces through form and function, Habitat International, 128, (2022); Brown, Christopher F., Dynamic World, Near real-time global 10 m land use land cover mapping, Scientific Data, 9, 1, (2022); Spatial Processes Models and Applications, (1981); Cohen, Jacob, A Coefficient of Agreement for Nominal Scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 1, pp. 37-46, (1960); Corbane, Christina, A global cloud free pixel- based image composite from Sentinel-2 data, Data in Brief, 31, (2020); Deng, Jia, ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database, pp. 248-255, (2009); undefined, (1990); Europe, (2021); Fleischmann, Martin, Geographical characterisation of British urban form and function using the spatial signatures framework, Scientific Data, 9, 1, (2022); Izzo, Stefano, Classification of urban functional zones through deep learning, Neural Computing and Applications, 34, 9, pp. 6973-6990, (2022)","M.

Here, we introduce a novel 3D Urban Growth Model (3D-UGM) that uniquely integrates vertical structural data, enabling enhanced analysis and prediction of urban development patterns. Our model employs an innovative blend of analytical techniques and scenario-based forecasting, setting a new standard in the field. We report that our horizontal urban growth simulations yield a cell-level mean Kappa value of 0.607 and a pattern-level agreement of 88 %. Additionally, our vertical growth predictions, informed by random forest algorithms, achieve a testing R2 of 0.909 and an average Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.239. Projecting future urban growth under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), our model forecasts a potential increase of up to 20 % in vertical development under SSP3 compared to SSP1. These projections offer a detailed glimpse into the diverse potential urban landscapes under differing environmental and economic scenarios. Our research makes a critical contribution to urban planning literature, providing a robust, data-driven foundation that informs sustainable development strategies, crucial for managing the complexities of vertical growth in rapidly urbanizing areas worldwide. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Random forest; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Urban three-dimensional simulation; Urban vertical growth,3D modeling; Forecasting; Forestry; Mean square error; Sustainable development; Multi-model ensemble; Random forests; Shared socioeconomic pathway; Socio-economics; Three dimensional simulations; Urban development; Urban growth modeling; Urban three-dimensional simulation; Urban vertical growth; Vertical growth; Urban growth; algorithm; growth modeling; machine learning; sustainable development; three-dimensional modeling; urban development; urban growth; urbanization; China; Hubei; Wuhan,,,,,,,"Aliaga, Daniel G., Visualization-based decision tool for urban meteorological modeling, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 40, 2, pp. 271-288, (2013); Batty, Michael J., From cells to cities, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 21, Celebration Issue, pp. 531-548, (1994); Benguigui, Lucien Gilles, Modeling cities in 3D: A cellular automaton approach, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 35, 3, pp. 413-430, (2008); Chen, Bin, Contrasting inequality in human exposure to greenspace between cities of Global North and Global South, Nature Communications, 13, 1, (2022); Chen, Guangzhao, Global projections of future urban land expansion under shared socioeconomic pathways, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Chen, Xuanchi, Enhanced urban growth modelling: Incorporating regional development heterogeneity and noise reduction in a cellular automata model - a case study of Zhengzhou, China, Sustainable Cities and Society, 99, (2023); Chen, Yimin, Delineating urban functional areas with building-level social media data: A dynamic time warping (DTW) distance based k-medoids method, Landscape and Urban Planning, 160, pp. 48-60, (2017); Chen, Yimin, An extended patch-based cellular automaton to simulate horizontal and vertical urban growth under the shared socioeconomic pathways, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 91, (2022); Clarke, Keith C., Loose-coupling a cellular automaton model and GIS: Long-term urban growth prediction for San Francisco and Washington/Baltimore, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 12, 7, pp. 699-714, (1998); Esch, Thomas, World Settlement Footprint 3D - A first three-dimensional survey of the global building stock, Remote Sensing of Environment, 270, (2022)","R.

The sensitivity of water transparency to nine water quality parameters, including chlorophyll a and inorganic suspended solids, in 16 urban landscape lakes of the city of Taiyuan was evaluated using the Sobol and Morris sensitivity analysis methods. The results indicate that for water bodies supplied by surface water, critical factors include chlorophyll a and hydraulic retention time. For water bodies supplied by tap water, inorganic suspended solids and total phosphorus are more significant. Water bodies with a dual function of urban flood control should focus on dissolved oxygen, ammonium nitrogen, and chemical oxygen demand.

As the seventh-leading cause of death in Canada, suicide necessitates targeted prevention strategies, especially in areas with lower suicide rates such as Ontario. To explore spatial patterns of suicide attempts and intentional self-inflicted injuries, individual-level data is collected and generalized to the census tract for rigorous spatial analyses. Self-Organizing Maps are utilized to build distinct regional clusters based on shared characteristics. These clusters unveil diverse combinations of suicide counts, religious affiliations, income levels, education levels, and immigrant populations, providing comprehensive insights into the multicultural composition of the area. The study findings reveal specific spatial patterns of suicide attempts associated with particular religious affiliations, shedding new light on the influence of faith and spirituality on mental health outcomes within the context of suicide prevention. The analysis underscores the importance of a nuanced understanding of these factors to guide effective suicide prevention interventions. Considering the spatial distribution of religious affiliations and suicide rates, this study offers valuable guidance for targeted and culturally sensitive suicide prevention efforts in the Greater Golden Horseshoe region and other similar urban landscapes.

Moreover, a strategic spatial sampling scheme from a data-centric perspective, informed by geographic and environmental diversity, optimizes the selection of representative samples to improve training efficiency and predictive accuracy. Comparative analyses demonstrate the framework's superior performance, achieving an F1 score of 84.30% and an intersection over union of 72.86% in rooftop segmentation, and Kappa scores of 74.67% and 70.04% in classifying urban functions and architectural types, outperforming other advanced models by 2% to 25% across various metrics.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how vulnerable cities are to unforeseen crises and underscored the urgent need for proactive urban planning strategies capable of navigating dynamic and unpredictable futures. In this context, the use of geographic information systems (GIS) offers researchers and decision makers a distinct advantage in the study of spatial data and enables the comprehensive study of spatial and temporal patterns in various disciplines, including real estate valuation. Central to the integration of modern technology into real estate valuation is the need to mitigate the inherent subjectivity of traditional valuation methods while increasing efficiency through the use of mass appraisal techniques. This study draws on extensive academic literature comprising 103 research articles published between 1993 and January 2024 to shed light on the multifaceted application of GISs in real estate valuation. In particular, three main areas are addressed: (1) hedonic models, (2) artificial intelligence (AI), and mathematical appraisal models. This synthesis emphasizes the interdependence of numerous societal challenges and highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address them effectively. In addition, this study provides a repertoire of methodologies that underscores the potential of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, GISs, and satellite imagery, to improve the subjectivity of traditional valuation approaches and thereby promote greater accuracy and productivity in real estate valuation. By integrating GISs into real estate valuation methodologies, stakeholders can navigate the complexity of urban landscapes with greater precision and promote equitable valuation practices that are conducive to sustainable urban development. © 2024 by the authors.",geoinformation/GI; GIS; mass appraisal; real estate valuation,,,,,,,,"Proceedings of the 24th Acm Sigspatial International Conference on Advances in Proceedings of the Geographic Information Systems Acm Sigspatial Gis 2016; Greenhalgh, Paul Michael, Using GIS to explore the potential of business rating data to analyse stock and value change for land administration: A case study of york, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 9, 5, (2020); Aesti Mum, (2012); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2016); Longley, Paul A., Research paper the predictive use of gis to model property valuations, International Journal of Geographical Information Systems, 8, 2, pp. 217-235, (1994); Pagourtzi, Elli, Architecture for a real estate analysis information system using GIS techniques integrated with fuzzy theory, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 24, 1, pp. 68-78, (2006); Weinzierl, Thomas, Assessment of future agricultural conditions in southwestern Africa using fuzzy logic and high-resolution climate model scenarios, Die Erde, 146, 4, pp. 259-270, (2015); Renigier-Biłozor, Małgorzata, Geoscience methods in real estate market analyses subjectivity decrease, Geosciences (Switzerland), 9, 3, (2019); Lasota, Tadeusz, Investigation of the eTS evolving fuzzy systems applied to real estate appraisal, Journal of Multiple-Valued Logic and Soft Computing, 17, 2-3, pp. 229-253, (2011); Morillo, M.

Given the significant impact of land shape on architectural and urban planning outcomes, its analysis is essential. However, studies on land shape have been limited due to the lack of definitive survey criteria. To address these challenges, this study utilized a map application programming interface (API) to gather raw data on apartment complex layouts in South Korea and processed these images using a Python-based image library. An initial analysis involved categorizing the data through K-means clustering. Each cluster’s average image was classified into four distinct groups for comparison with the existing literature. Shape indices were employed to analyze land configurations and assess consistency across classes. These classes were annotated on a parcel level using the Roboflow API, and YOLOv8s-cls was developed to classify the parcels effectively. The evaluation of this model involved calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score from a confusion matrix. The results show a strong correlation between the identified and established classes, with the YOLO model achieving an accuracy of 86% and demonstrating robust prediction capabilities across classes. This confirms the effective typification of land shapes in the studied apartment complexes. This study introduces a methodology for analyzing parcel shapes through machine learning and deep learning. It asserts that this approach transcends the confines of South Korean apartment complexes, extending its applicability to architectural and urban design planning on a global scale. Analyzing land shapes earmarked for construction enables the formulation of diverse design strategies for building placement and external space arrangement. This highlights the potential for innovative design approaches in architectural and urban planning worldwide. © 2024 by the authors.",apartment complex; deep learning; image classification; machine learning; YOLOv8,Apartment houses; Application programming interfaces (API); Architectural design; Deep learning; K-means clustering; Land use; Learning systems; Python; Urban planning; Apartment complexes; Applications programming interfaces; Image library; Images classification; Land parcels; Learning techniques; Machine-learning; South Korea; YOLOv8; Image classification,,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Hyupsung University, UHS",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.RS-2022-0016605712482147660003) and the Hyupsung University Research Grant of 2024).,"J Urban Des Inst Korea, (2009); Master Thesis, (2016); Journal of Real Estate Analysis, (2017); Guidelines for Investigation and Calculation of Individual Official Land Price Applied in 2023, (2023); Self Studying Machine Learning Deep Learning, (2020); Journal of the Korean Cartographic Association, (2017); Fragstats Spatial Pattern Analysis Program for Quantifying Landscape Structure, (1995); A Study on Improvement of Land Characteristic Survey, (2015); Demetriou, Demetris, A parcel shape index for use in land consolidation planning, Transactions in GIS, 17, 6, pp. 861-882, (2013); Lee, Ju-mi, Comparison of models to forecast real estates index introducing machine learning, Journal of the Architectural Institute of Korea, 37, 1, pp. 191-199, (2021)","S.-E.

Hence, the visual coherence of buildings (VCoB) plays a crucial role in such areas, not only pertaining to the visual quality of the urban landscape but also regarding the preservation of historic features. The accurate measurement of the VCoB is a prerequisite for undertaking optimization efforts. However, discussions of the VCoB in the built environment are limited and seldom address residential historic areas, and methods for measuring the VCoB have yet to be refined. Therefore, taking the Xiaoxihu Historic Area in Nanjing as a case study, this work aimed to develop a more refined method for measuring the VCoB in residential historic areas based on objective physical features. The method is mainly based on the human-level perspective, identifying three key visual elements within this perspective as the objects of measurement. It collected visual data through photography, with deep learning and computer graphics processing tools being utilized to identify and extract the visual elements. Then, the study established a corresponding framework of indicators for different visual elements and optimizes the methods for indicator calculation. Through an assessment involving professionals, we validated the high accuracy of the measurement method proposed in this study. Furthermore, the study discusses factors affecting the VCoB, methods to enhance the VCoB, and the required degree of the VCoB based on the results of the measurement. The method developed in this research will provide support for the visual analysis of the urban built environment and urban renewal practices. © 2024 by the authors.",buildings; historic residential areas; measurement method; visual coherence,Computer graphics; Historic preservation; Housing; Built environment; Case-studies; Historic residential area; Measurement methods; Nanjing; Residential areas; Residential building; Urban renewal; Visual coherence; Visual elements; Deep learning,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52278009); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",This research received funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52278009).,"Carmon, Naomi, Three generations of urban renewal policies: analysis and policy implications, Geoforum, 30, 2, pp. 145-158, (1999); Zheng, Wei Wei, A review of recent studies on sustainable urban renewal, Habitat International, 41, pp. 272-279, (2014); Wang, Hao, The Relationship Between Urban Renewal and the Built Environment: A Systematic Review and Bibliometric Analysis, Journal of Planning Literature, 37, 2, pp. 293-308, (2022); Couch, Chris, Thirty years of urban regeneration in Britain, Germany and France: The importance of context and path dependency, Progress in Planning, 75, 1, pp. 1-52, (2011); Historic Environment Policy Practice, (2013); Procedia Soc Behav Sci, (2016); Spennemann, Dirk H.R., What Actually Is a Heritage Conservation Area?

Meso-scale cities are the most developed cities in China and play an important role in economic and social development. The current robot technology is mainly divided into industrial robots and service robots, which can play an important role in the development of cities. This paper aims to apply AI robotics technology to the analysis and intelligent management of mesoscale urban design genealogy. Firstly, the development pedigree of the mesoscale city was analyzed, from which the characteristics of previous designs could be clearly understood. Then, the urban management and control system is intelligently designed from many aspects, the characteristics of the robot are analyzed, and the application of the intelligent robot in urban design is introduced. After that, four developing meso‑scale cities in a province were selected as the evaluation objects, and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was proposed to evaluate the application effect of robotics technology in meso‑scale cities. The results showed that the overall score of the robot in urban traffic design was greater than 70 points, and the overall score of urban architectural design was greater than 65 points, which was in the acceptable range. In the application score of urban environment design, the influence was about 70 to 80 points, and the aesthetics was more than 75 points. The cultural aspect of the design impact score was no more than 75 points, while the cultural support aspect score was around 80 points. After the weight calculation, the final overall score was 489 points, and the comprehensive average score was 36 points. The overall composite score and average score were both good. This showed that the application of robot technology to the pedigree analysis and intelligent management and control of mesoscale urban design could achieve good results. © 2024",Analytic hierarchy process; Intelligent management and control; Medium-scale urban design; Pedigree analysis; Robot technology,Economic and social effects; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Machine design; Process control; Intelligent management; Intelligent management and control; Management and controls; Medium-scale; Medium-scale urban design; Meso scale; Pedigree analysis; Robot technology; Urban design; Urban management; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,,,"Aksoy, Ercüment, Geographical information systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) integration for sustainable landfill site selection considering dynamic data source, Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment, 78, 2, pp. 779-791, (2019); Basdeki, Aikaterini, Design, calculations and performance evaluation of rain gardens in an urban neighborhood of Thessaloniki, Greece, Desalination and Water Treatment, 99, pp. 4-9, (2017); Bertelsen, Ann Sophia, Use of robot technology in passive mobilization of acute hospitalized geriatric medicine patients: A pilot test and feasibility study, Pilot and Feasibility Studies, 6, 1, (2020); Đorđević, Vladimir, Data-driven control of hydraulic servo actuator: An event-triggered adaptive dynamic programming approach, Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, 20, 5, pp. 8561-8582, (2023); Esfandeh, Sorour, Climate change risk of urban growth and land use/land cover conversion: An in‐depth review of the recent research in Iran, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 1, (2022); Chemical Technology Control and Management, (2018); Habibzadeh, Hadi, Smart city system design: A comprehensive study of the application and data planes, ACM Computing Surveys, 52, 2, (2020); Hwang, Kitae, Performance Monitoring of MQTT-based Messaging Server and System, Journal of Logistics, Informatics and Service Science, 9, 1, pp. 85-96, (2022); Kamal, Elkhatib, Intelligent Energy Management Strategy Based on Artificial Neural Fuzzy for Hybrid Vehicle, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, 3, 1, pp. 112-125, (2018); Kim, Kyuwon, Design of integrated risk management-based dynamic driving control of automated vehicles, IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine, 9, 1, pp. 57-73, (2017)",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,26673053,,,,English,Intell.

South America's urban development and trees are closely interconnected, and tree cover within cities plays a vital role in shaping sustainable and resilient urban landscapes. However, knowledge of urban tree canopy (UTC) coverage in the South American continent remains limited. In this study, we used high-resolution satellite images and developed a semi-supervised deep learning method to create UTC data for 888 South American cities. The proposed semi-supervised method can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data during training. By incorporating labeled data for guidance and utilizing unlabeled data to explore underlying patterns, the algorithm enhances model robustness and generalization for urban tree canopy detection across South America, with an average overall accuracy of 94.88% for the tested cities. Based on the created UTC products, we successfully assessed the UTC coverage for each city. Statistical results showed that the UTC coverage in South America is between 0.76% and 69.53%, and the average UTC coverage is approximately 19.99%. Among the 888 cities, only 357 cities that accommodate approximately 48.25% of the total population have UTC coverage greater than 20%, while the remaining 531 cities that accommodate approximately 51.75% of the total population have UTC coverage less than 20%. Natural factors (climatic and geographical) play a very important role in determining UTC coverage, followed by human activity factors (economy and urbanization level). We expect that the findings of this study and the created UTC dataset will help formulate policies and strategies to promote sustainable urban forestry, thus further improving the quality of life of residents in South America. © 2024 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Remote sensing; South America; Urban sustainable development; Urban tree canopy,Deep learning; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Supervised learning; Urban growth; Canopy coverage; Fine-scale; High resolution satellite images; Remote-sensing; South America; Urban development; Urban sustainable development; Urban tree canopies; Urban trees; Remote sensing; canopy; image resolution; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sustainable development; tree; urban development,,,,,"Munich Center for Machine Learning, MCML; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01DD20001); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi, (50EE2201C); Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by part by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the international future AI Laboratory \u201CAI4EO-Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation: Reasoning, Uncertainties, Ethics and Beyond\u201D under Grant 01DD20001, in part by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology in the framework of the \u201CNational Center of excellence ML4Earth\u201D under Grant 50EE2201C, and in part by the Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the L\u00E4nder through the TUM Innovation Network EarthCare and by Munich Center for Machine Learning.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by part by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the international future AI Laboratory \u201CAI4EO-Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation: Reasoning, Uncertainties, Ethics and Beyond\u201D under Grant 01DD20001 , and in part by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology in the framework of the \u201CNational Center of excellence ML4Earth\u201D under Grant 50EE2201C .","Aval, Josselin, Object-based fusion for urban tree species classification from hyperspectral, panchromatic and nDSM data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 40, 14, pp. 5339-5365, (2019); Banzhaf, Ellen, Monitoring the urban tree cover for urban ecosystem services -The case of Leipzig, Germany, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 40, 7W3, pp. 301-305, (2015); Ordóñez-Barona, Camilo, Trends in Urban Forestry Research in Latin America & The Caribbean: A Systematic Literature Review and Synthesis, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 47, (2020); Nooraei Beidokhti, Alireza, The effects of precipitation, tree phenology, leaf area index, and bark characteristics on throughfall rates by urban trees: A meta-data analysis, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 60, (2021); Bengio, Yoshua, Practical recommendations for gradient-based training of deep architectures, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7700 LECTURE NO, pp. 437-478, (2012); Environ Dev Sustain, (2022); Bolyn, Corentin, Mapping tree species proportions from satellite imagery using spectral–spatial deep learning, Remote Sensing of Environment, 280, (2022); Brandt, Martin Stefan, Reduction of tree cover in West African woodlands and promotion in semi-arid farmlands, Nature Geoscience, 11, 5, pp. 328-333, (2018); Brandt, Martin Stefan, An unexpectedly large count of trees in the West African Sahara and Sahel, Nature, 587, 7832, pp. 78-82, (2020); Breger, Benjamin S., Urban tree survival and stewardship in a state-managed planting initiative: A case study in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 43, (2019)","J.

Past studies, however, have primarily concentrated on regional and urban scales. The complexities of human-environment interactions necessitate a more fine-grained measure of urban morphology beyond two-dimensional spaces. This study delves into the intricacies of horizontal and vertical urban surfaces within community life circles. It examines human-scale landscapes using a bottom-up metric system that includes eye-level quality, road network design, buildings and functions, and neighborhood location. The methods of deep learning and street view images are utilized to evaluate the eye-level morphology. The study then analyzes the heterogeneous impacts and interaction effects of morphological variables on urban vitality at the community life circle level through multiscale geographic weighted regression and geographical detector model. The findings reveal a core-periphery structure and strong spatial autocorrelations between the morphological variables and urban vitality. Furthermore, the determinants of urban vitality exhibit a blend of global, regional, and local spatial contexts. The human-observed greenery, sky openness, and public bus accessibility demonstrate significant spatial heterogeneity linked to local vitality, whereas street betweenness and commercial facilities exhibit limited effects. The interaction effects between morphological variables can either enhance or weaken their individual impacts, highlighting the need for community life circle planning that considers the combined effects of these variables.

As an important criterion for residents' social interaction and mobility vigor, collective walking describes the results of walking activities in streets and positively correlates with the built environments. However, limited attention has been given to the contribution of built environment factors in peri-urban areas towards promoting collective walking. Therefore, this study employed multisource data to assess the impact of these factors on collective walking in peri-urban areas. Our analysis delved into the impact of these factors on collective walking across various urban spaces and explored intervention effects through cross-classification studies that prioritize planning strategies. These results revealed that (1) The impacts of the built environment on collective walking behavior differs in peri-urban areas. (2) Diversity and distance only show significant impacts in peri-urban areas. (3) A distinct spatial mismatch between urban spatial form and collective walking behavior is observed. Subsequent urban design interventions should consider these spatial distribution differences for prioritized zoning planning. Our findings provided convincing evidence that delineated the impact of built environments in peri-urban areas that can guide government and planners to precisely design pedestrian environments through targeted intervention measures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Collective walking behavior; Machine learning; Peri-urban area; Street view image,GIS; periurban area; residential mobility; satellite imagery; spatial distribution; travel behavior; urban design; walking; zoning policy; Chengdu; China; Sichuan,,,,,,,"Abenoza, Roberto F., What is the role of weather, built-environment and accessibility geographical characteristics in influencing travelers’ experience?, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 122, pp. 34-50, (2019); Ahani, Somayeh, A review of domains, approaches, methods and indicators in peri-urbanization literature, Habitat International, 114, (2021); Amirinejad, Ghazal, Ambiguity at the peri-urban interface in Australia, Land Use Policy, 78, pp. 472-480, (2018); Ao, Yibin, Influences of rural built environment on travel mode choice of rural residents: The case of rural Sichuan, Journal of Transport Geography, 85, (2020); Asfandiyarova, L.

With the increase in heavy precipitations, the ability to proactively identify flash floods hotspots in cities is critical for flood nowcasting and predictive monitoring of risks. While rainfall runoff models and hydrologic models are useful models for flash flood prediction, these models are computationally expensive and effort intensive to be used for flood nowcasting. To address this challenge, this study presents interpretable machine learning models for predicting urban flash flood hotspots based on intertwined land and built environment features. The task of predicting flash flood hotspots is formulated as a binary classification problem, and three recent flash flood events in U.S. cities are selected for data collection and model validation. Various features related to land and built environment characteristics are constructed using diverse datasets, and the occurrences of flash floods are captured using crowdsource data from the events. Using these features and datasets, the flash flood hotspots of cities are predicted with two ensemble models based on decision trees. The results demonstrate that the models can achieve good accuracy (0.8) in identifying flooded/non-flooded locations. Especially, the models can achieve high true positive rate (0.83–0.89) and low missing rate, demonstrating the methods' practicability for accurately predicting flooded hotspots. The model interpretation results indicate that land features related to hydrological and topological features have greater impacts on flash flood risk, than built environment features. Further analysis reveals that the feature importance, model performance, and model transferability performance vary among cities and localized specifications of the models are needed for accurate prediction of flash flood for a particular city. The data-driven machine learning models presented in this study provide a useful tool for predicting flash flood hotspots based on the intertwined features of land and the built environment in cities to enable nowcasting and proactive monitoring of flash flood hotspots for emergency response and also inform integrated urban design and development towards flash flood risk reduction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Crowdsourced data; Flash flood; Machine learning,Crowdsourcing; Decision trees; Forecasting; Machine learning; Built environment; Crowdsourced data; Flash-floods; Hotspots; Land environments; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Nowcasting; Pluvials; Urban areas; Floods; accuracy assessment; data interpretation; flash flood; flood forecasting; machine learning; rainfall-runoff modeling; risk assessment; urban design,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1832662)","The authors would like to acknowledge funding support from the National Science Foundation CRISP 2.0 Type 2 No. 1832662: “Anatomy of Coupled Human-Infrastructure Systems Resilience to Urban Flooding: Integrated Assessment of Social, Institutional, and Physical Networks.” Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this research are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the view of the funding agencies.","Agonafir, Candace, A machine learning approach to evaluate the spatial variability of New York City's 311 street flooding complaints, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 97, (2022); Bagan, Hasi, Analysis of urban growth and estimating population density using satellite images of nighttime lights and land-use and population data, GIScience and Remote Sensing, 52, 6, pp. 765-780, (2015); Bates, Paul D., Uncertainty in flood inundation modelling, pp. 232-269, (2014); Blum, Annalise G., Causal Effect of Impervious Cover on Annual Flood Magnitude for the United States, Geophysical Research Letters, 47, 5, (2020); Bradford, Roisin A., Risk perception - Issues for flood management in Europe, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 12, 7, pp. 2299-2309, (2012); Chiang, Shen, Comparison of Rainfall-Runoff Simulation between Support Vector Regression and HEC-HMS for a Rural Watershed in Taiwan, Water (Switzerland), 14, 2, (2022); Choubin, B., An ensemble prediction of flood susceptibility using multivariate discriminant analysis, classification and regression trees, and support vector machines, Science of the Total Environment, 651, pp. 2087-2096, (2019); undefined, (2022); undefined, (2022); Dong, Shangjia, Predictive multi-watershed flood monitoring using deep learning on integrated physical and social sensors data, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 49, 7, pp. 1838-1856, (2022)","Z.

Employing a novel approach that combines street view data and deep learning technology, the research aims to identify and map the spatial distribution of Tibetan Buddhist spiritual sites against the backdrop of the urban landscape. Our analysis reveals a notable concentration of these spiritual places near urban architectural and cultural heritage areas, highlighting the profound connection between residents' cultural life and spiritual practices. Despite challenges posed by modern urbanisation, these spiritual sites demonstrate resilience and adaptability, continuing to serve as cultural and spiritual pillars of the Tibetan Buddhist community. This study contributes to the fields of urban planning, religious studies, and digital humanities by demonstrating the potential of technology in examining the impact of urban development on cultural and religious landscapes. The research underscores the importance of protecting and integrating spaces of spiritual perception in urban development planning. It shows that safeguarding these spaces is crucial not only for cultural heritage preservation but also for achieving sustainable urban development and social harmony.

This paper explores the application of generative models in automating vlog content creation. It addresses both static and dynamic visual elements, eliminating the need for human intervention. Traditional vlogs often require specific environmental conditions and proper lighting for the vlog creation. To streamline this process, an automated system utilizing the generative models is proposed here. Generative models excel at generating realistic content that seamlessly integrates with real-world content. They enhance overall video quality and introduce creative elements by generating new scenes and backgrounds. This paper categorizes various generative modeling techniques based on frame elements and foreground-background conditions. It offers a comparative analysis of different generative model variants tailored for specific objectives. Furthermore, the paper reviews existing research on generative models for video and image content generation, visual quality enhancement, diversity, and coherence outcomes. Additionally, the paper highlights practical uses of the generative model for content creation in various contexts, such as face swapping, scene translation, and virtual content insertion. The paper also examines the public datasets used to train generative models. These datasets contain diverse visual content such as celebrity images, urban landscapes, and everyday scenes. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Computer vision; Deep learning; Generative modeling; Image synthesis; Video synthesis,Automation; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Content creation; Generative model; High quality images; High-quality videos; Image texts; Images synthesis; Modeling approach; Potential tool; Video synthesis; Computer vision,,,,,,,"Kumar, Lalit, Performance Evaluation of Video-to-Video Synthesis GAN models on Cityscapes Dataset, (2023); Ruthotto, Lars, An introduction to deep generative modeling, GAMM Mitteilungen, 44, 2, (2021); Kumar, Lalit, A comprehensive survey on generative adversarial networks used for synthesizing multimedia content, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 82, 26, pp. 40585-40624, (2023); Kumar, Lalit, Comparative analysis of Vid2Vid and Fast Vid2Vid Models for Video-to-Video Synthesis on Cityscapes Dataset, (2023); undefined; undefined; Dimitri, Giovanna Maria, Multimodal and multicontrast image fusion via deep generative models, Information Fusion, 88, pp. 146-160, (2022); Indian J Sci Technol, (2016); Wang, Shengyu, Sketch Your Own GAN, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 14030-14040, (2021); Li, Xinyu, Region-based activity recognition using conditional CAN, pp. 1059-1067, (2017)","L.

With densely built modernist architecture and relatively free building regulations, it is challenging to trace the actual development of the whole city. Compared to European cities, their overall urban landscapes are much denser, higher, and functionally mixed. In order to achieve a quicker and more accurate identification of urban forms in mega-cities, this study proposed a two-level machine-learning approach. At the building level, we extracted features from topographic maps and building licenses to automatically classify building types. Four state-of-the-art multi-class classification models were compared. At the block level, we used building types as input data and compared two methods for block clustering. In total 61,426 buildings from Taipei were classified and grouped into 10 block types. Different from Western cities, many of the block types in Taipei were mixtures of different types of buildings. This approach is efficient in exploring new urban form types, especially for emerging mega-cities where block types are previously unknown. The result not only sheds light on the features of East Asian urban landscapes but also serves as important basis of type-based strategic plans for contemporary urban issues. © The Author(s) 2023.",building classification; clustering; East Asia; machine learning; urban form,building; classification; cluster analysis; machine learning; megacity; urban morphology; Far East,,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the PhD grant by Ministry of Education, Taiwan.","Tensorflow Large Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, (2015); Araldi, Alessandro, From the street to the metropolitan region: Pedestrian perspective in urban fabric analysis, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 46, 7, pp. 1243-1263, (2019); Arundel, Rowan, The role of urban form in sustainability of community: The case of Amsterdam, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 44, 1, pp. 33-53, (2017); Bai, Yingjiu, Urban warming and urban heat islands in Taipei, Taiwan, pp. 231-246, (2011); Bard, Sylvain, Quality assessment of cartographic generalisation, Transactions in GIS, 8, 1, pp. 63-81, (2004); Beck, Anthony, Automated classification metrics for energy modelling of residential buildings in the UK with open algorithms, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 47, 1, pp. 45-64, (2020); Stadtebaulicher Rahmenplan Klimaanpassung Fur Die Stadt Karlsruhe Teil II, (2014); Belgiu, Mariana, Ontology-based classification of building types detected from airborne laser scanning data, Remote Sensing, 6, 2, pp. 1347-1366, (2014); Beyhan, Burak, An algorithm for maximum inscribed circle based on Voronoi diagrams and geometrical properties, Journal of Geographical Systems, 22, 3, pp. 391-418, (2020); Shaping Cities in an Urban Age, (2018)","C.-Y.

However, the definition and measurement of urban vibrancy have not been consistently and clearly followed. With the development of technologies such as big data and machine learning, urban planners have adopted new methods that enable better quantitative evaluation of urban performance. This research attempts to quantify the impact on the urban vibrancy of the urban interventions introduced by the LivingLine project in a residential neighborhood renovation made in Siping Street, Shanghai. We use Wi-Fi probes to process collected mobile phone data and segment people into different categories according to commuting patterns analysis. We use a pre-trained random forest model to determine the specific locations of each person. Subsequently, we analyze the behavior patterns of people from stay points detection and trajectory analysis. Through statistical models, we apply multi-linear regression and find that urban intervention (well-curated and defined lab events deployed in the street) and people’s behavior are positively correlated, which helps us to prove the impact of urban intervention on street dynamics. The research proposes a novel, evidence-based, low-cost methodology for studying granular behavior patterns on a street level without compromising users’ data privacy. © The Author(s) 2023.",behavioral analysis; machine learning; multi-linear regression; Street activities; urban vibrancy; Wi-Fi data,algorithm; commuting; machine learning; neighborhood; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; China; Shanghai,,,,,,,"Barreca, Alice, Urban vibrancy: An emerging factor that spatially influences the real estate market, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 1, (2020); Bellomo, Nicola, Human behaviours in evacuation crowd dynamics: From modelling to “big data” toward crisis management, Physics of Life Reviews, 18, pp. 1-21, (2016); Comput Syst Appl, (2020); Calabrese, Francesco, Eigenplaces: Segmenting space through digital signatures, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 9, 1, pp. 78-84, (2010); Crowd Data Analytics as Seen from Wifi A Critical Review, (2019); Gansner, Emden R., Multilevel agglomerative edge bundling for visualizing large graphs, pp. 187-194, (2011); Griffiths, Ron, Cultural strategies and new modes of urban intervention, Cities, 12, 4, pp. 253-265, (1995); Hu, Xinyu, Using Wi-Fi probe and location data to analyze the human distribution characteristics of green spaces: A case study of the Yanfu Greenland Park, China, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 54, (2020); Huang, Bo, Evaluating and characterizing urban vibrancy using spatial big data: Shanghai as a case study, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 47, 9, pp. 1543-1559, (2020); Death and Life of Great American Cities, (1961)","J.

However, existing assessment methods often lack temporal dynamics or heavily rely on historical big data, limiting their ability to accurately predict outcomes for unbuilt projects. To address these challenges, this study integrates previous methodologies with observations of crowd characteristics in public spaces. It introduces the crowd-frequency hypothesis and develops an algorithm to establish a time-dimensional urban vitality dynamic prediction model. Through a case study of the Rundle Mall neighborhood in Adelaide, Australia, the effectiveness of the prediction model was validated using on-site observation sampling and comparative verification. The prediction model framework allows for the determination of urban vitality within specific time ranges by directly inputting basic information, providing valuable support to urban planners and government officials during the design and decision-making processes. It offers a cost-effective approach to achieve sustainable urban vitality construction. Furthermore, machine learning techniques, specifically the decision tree model, were applied to case data to develop a set of preliminary algorithm tools, which enable output of reference urban vitality levels (high-medium-low). © 2024 by the authors.",algorithm; crowd-frequency; prediction model; urban vitality,algorithm; government; hypothesis testing; neighborhood; numerical model; prediction; public space; Adelaide; Australia; South Australia,,,,,(19FXWB026); (HITSZERP19001); (GXWD20201230155427003-20200822174038001); (400715),"This research was funded by: Later Funded Projects of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China, grant number No. 19FXWB026; Higher Education Research and Reform Project of Guangdong Province (No. HITSZERP19001); General Project of Stabilization Support Program of Shenzhen Universities (No. GXWD20201230155427003-20200822174038001); Key Laboratory of Cognitive and Personality, Ministry of Education, Chongqing, 400715; Shenzhen Education Science \u201C14th Five-Year Plan\u201D 2022 Annual Topic (No.: cgpy22018).","Moser, Sarah, Forest city, Malaysia, and Chinese expansionism, Urban Geography, 39, 6, pp. 935-943, (2018); Shi, Lifeng, Urbanization that hides in the dark – Spotting China's “ghost neighborhoods” from space, Landscape and Urban Planning, 200, (2020); Eur Stud, (2017); Wang, Jian, Driving factors of urban shrinkage: Examining the role of local industrial diversity, Cities, 99, (2020); Yang, Zhenshan, Are cities losing their vitality?

Deep learning techniques tackle urban complexity and diversity, which unlocks a broad range of applications. These include urban planning, transportation management, autonomous driving, and smart city efforts. Through rich context and insights, semantic segmentation helps decision-makers and stakeholders make educated decisions for sustainable and effective urban development. This study investigates an in-depth exploration of cityscape image segmentation using the U-Net deep learning model. The proposed U-Net architecture comprises an encoder and decoder structure. The encoder uses convolutional layers and down sampling to extract hierarchical information from input images. Each down sample step reduces spatial dimensions, and increases feature depth, aiding context acquisition. Batch normalization and dropout layers stabilize models and prevent overfitting during encoding. The decoder reconstructs higher-resolution feature maps using ""UpSampling2D"" layers. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation of the Cityscapes dataset, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the U-Net model in achieving state-of-the-art results in image segmentation. The results clearly shown that, the proposed model has high accuracy, mean IOU and mean DICE compared to existing models. © 2024 Arulananth et al.

However, the nonlinear and interaction relationships between multilevel (macroscale and microscale) BE and outdoor jogging are poorly explained. Therefore, this work established an explainable machine learning-based analytical framework that integrating Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the nonlinear and interaction effects. Employing Beijing, China as the case, this study conducted an empirical analysis of multilevel BE factors affecting outdoor jogging utilizing multi-source big data, including large-scale jogging GPS trajectories and street view images. Results revealed that: (1) Macroscale BE including sports amenities and accessibility play an important role in affecting jogging. (2) All BE factors have nonlinear association with jogging, and the effective range and threshold effects vary by variables. Notably, several variables associated with jogging are in inverted U or V shapes. (3) The complex interaction effects including synergistic, weakened, among BE factors were scrutinized. BE factors regarding accessibility and sports amenity interact more easily. (4) Regions with similar local effects were clustered to understand the spatial varying of BE's influences and establish targeted interventions. These findings can help urban planners design more nuanced intervention strategies for supporting outdoor jogging. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Explainable machine learning; Interaction effects; Nonlinear association; Outdoor jogging activity,accessibility; environmental factor; GPS; image analysis; machine learning; nonlinearity; physical activity; social behavior; urban design; urban geography; urban planning; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China,,,,,"(2020YBGL88); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42001333, 42371421); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 42001333 , 42371421 ), and Philosophy and Social Science Planning research project of Chongqing ( 2020YBGL88 ).","Adlakha, Deepti, Neighborhood-based differences in walkability, physical activity, and weight status in India, Journal of Transport and Health, 3, 4, pp. 485-499, (2016); Alfonzo, Mariela A., To walk or not to walk?

This paper presents a novel framework that integrates street greenery with accessibility, enabling a detailed evaluation of the daily street-level greenery visible to residents. This pioneering approach introduces a new measurement methodology to quantify the quality of urban street greening, providing robust empirical evidence to support its enhancement. This study delves into Nanjing’s five districts, employing advanced image semantic segmentation based on machine learning techniques to segment and extract green vegetation from Baidu Street View (BSV) images. Leveraging spatial syntax, it analyzes street network data sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to quantify the accessibility values of individual streets. Subsequent overlay analyses uncover areas characterized by high accessibility but inadequate street greening, underscoring the pressing need for street greening enhancements in highly accessible zones, thereby providing valuable decision-making support for urban planners. Key findings revealed that (1) the green view index (GVI) of sampled points within the study area ranged from 15.79% to 38.17%, with notably better street greening conditions observed in the Xuanwu District; (2) the Yuhua District exhibited comparatively lower pedestrian and commuting accessibility than the Xuanwu District; and (3) approximately 139.62 km of roads in the study area demonstrated good accessibility but lacked sufficient greenery visibility, necessitating immediate improvements in their green landscapes. This research utilizes the potential of novel data and methodologies, along with their practical applications in planning and design practices. Notably, this study integrates street greenery visibility with accessibility to explore, from a human-centered perspective, the tangible benefits of green landscapes. These insights highlight the opportunity for local governments to advance urban planning and design by implementing more human-centered green space policies, ultimately promoting societal equity. © 2024 by the authors.",accessibility; image semantic segmentation; machine learning; space syntax; street greenery; street view,Decision making; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Syntactics; Urban planning; Visibility; Accessibility; Image semantic segmentation; Image semantics; Machine-learning; Semantic segmentation; Space syntax; Street greenery; Street view; Study areas; Urban streets; Machine learning; accessibility; greenspace; image processing; local government; machine learning; modeling; segmentation; urban design; urban planning; Area; Data; Decision Making; Design; Planning; Quality; Segmentation; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu],,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (23SHC002, BK20201359); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; (2019ZD007)","This research was funded by Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, grant number 23SHC002; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, grant number BK20201359; and Science and Technology Plan Project of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Housing and Urban Rural Development, grant number 2019ZD007.","Soga, Masashi, A room with a green view: the importance of nearby nature for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ecological Applications, 31, 2, (2021); Nutsford, Daniel, An ecological study investigating the association between access to urban green space and mental health, Public Health, 127, 11, pp. 1005-1011, (2013); Liotta, Charlotte, Planning for environmental justice - reducing well-being inequalities through urban greening, Environmental Science and Policy, 112, pp. 47-60, (2020); Williams, Tim G., Parks and safety: a comparative study of green space access and inequity in five US cities, Landscape and Urban Planning, 201, (2020); Pearsall, Hamil, Locating the green space paradox: A study of gentrification and public green space accessibility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Landscape and Urban Planning, 195, (2020); Ishikawa, Noriko, Effects of street landscape planting and urban public parks on dwelling environment evaluation in Japan, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 11, 4, pp. 390-395, (2012); Stessens, Philip, Analysing urban green space accessibility and quality: A GIS-based model as spatial decision support for urban ecosystem services in Brussels, Ecosystem Services, 28, pp. 328-340, (2017); Cetin, M., Using GIS analysis to assess urban green space in terms of accessibility: Case study in Kutahya, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 22, 5, pp. 420-424, (2015); Yang, Jun, Can you see green?

The results showed significant differences between the three AI models, as well as differing scores across urban scenes, suggesting that some projects and design elements may be more challenging for AI art generators to represent visually. Analysis of individual design elements showed high accuracy in common features like skyscrapers and lawns, but less frequency in depicting unique elements such as sculptures and transit stops. AI-generated urban designs have potential applications in the early stages of exploration when rapid ideation and visual brainstorming are key.

To date, only a few studies have used image analytics and deep learning methods to attempt to estimate these concepts based on a training set of user rated images. We aimed to 1) test whether the use of deep learning could be applied to predict perceptions of beauty, restorativeness, and naturalness in Google Street View (GSV) imagery (n = 3598 from across the USA); and 2) understand whether researcher-assigned theoretical constructs from the literature predict these concepts in intentionally-selected imagery (n = 6). A national sample of participants (n = 10,727) ranked the qualities of 11 randomly assigned images. We found it difficult to accurately predict ratings of beauty, restorativeness, and naturalness using GSV images. Consistently important image variables for the better-performing models included the total edge contrast index, the interspersion-juxtaposition index, and vertical vegetation. Important rater metrics include the binary Hispanic variable and the time the rater took to complete the survey. We also found similar correlations between the concepts of beauty, restorativeness, and naturalness by sex, urbanicity, and race/ethnicity whereby beauty and restorativeness had the largest correlation. We also found distinct constructs in the intentionally-selected images. Beauty and restorativeness could be predicted by the presence of water, and urban, maintained scenes. Imagery with greenery of various heights was associated with lower beauty and restorativeness and higher naturalness. Pure nature scenes were associated with both higher restorativeness and naturalness. For all three concepts, crowded views were significantly associated with lower values. Distinctly, expansive views were associated with beauty, and scenes with traditional structures were associated with lower naturalness. Future research may usefully explore geographic differences in ratings and the past experiences of participants, as drivers of image perceptions. Accurate prediction of image perceptions and understanding why certain people view or do not view particular images as beautiful, restorative, or natural may inform efforts to promote mental health through urban design. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Blue space; Google Street View; Green space; Mental health; Perceptions,greenspace; image analysis; mental health; perception; spatiotemporal analysis; United States,,,,,,Funding for half of the Amazon Mechanical Turk surveys came from Michigan State University's Center for Data Analytics.,"undefined, (2020); Bell, Sarah L., Green space, health and wellbeing: Making space for individual agency, Health and Place, 30, pp. 287-292, (2014); Berman, Marc G., The perception of naturalness correlates with low-level visual Features of environmental scenes, PLOS ONE, 9, 12, (2014); Berman, Marc G., The cognitive benefits of interacting with nature, Psychological Science, 19, 12, pp. 1207-1212, (2008); Berto, Rita, The role of nature in coping with psycho-physiological stress: A literature review on restorativeness, Behavioral Sciences, 4, 4, pp. 394-409, (2014); Aesthetic Measure, (1933); Brown, Daniel K., Viewing nature scenes positively affects recovery of autonomic function following acute-mental stress, Environmental Science and Technology, 47, 11, pp. 5562-5569, (2013); Carrus, Giuseppe, Relations between naturalness and perceived restorativeness of different urban green spaces, Psyecology, 4, 3, pp. 227-244, (2013); Chon, Jinhyung, Aesthetic responses to urban greenway trail environments, Landscape Research, 34, 1, pp. 83-104, (2009); Conradson, David, Landscape, care and the relational self: Therapeutic encounters in rural England, Health and Place, 11, 4, pp. 337-348, (2005)","A.L.

Our sample size included 61 million outpatient encounters across 1169 zipcodes, with 63% women and 30% elderly. A total of 369,344 mental health encounters were identified, with anxiety/stress and depression encounters representing 68.3% and 23.6%, respectively. We found that neighborhoods with a NatureScore of 60+ had lower overall mental health utilization than those below 40 (RR 0.51, 95%CI 0.38–0.69). This relationship persisted for depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety/stress and in neighborhoods with a NatureScore above 80 (p < 0.001). Compared to neighborhoods with a NatureScore below 40, those above 80 had significantly lower depression (aRR 0.68, 95%CI 0.49–0.95) and bipolar (aRR 0.59, 95%CI 0.36–0.99) health encounters after adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors. This novel approach, utilizing NatureScore as a proxy for urban greenness, demonstrates the correlation between a higher NatureScore and reduced mental health utilization. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating nature into our healthcare strategies to promote well-being and mental health. © 2024 by the authors.",depression; mental health; nature; NatureScore; stress; urban design,demography; mental health; neighborhood; socioeconomic conditions; urban area; urban design; adult; age; aged; analysis of variance; anxiety; Article; bipolar disorder; cross-sectional study; depression; employment; ethnicity; female; gender; household income; human; ICD-10-CM; ICD-9; International Classification of Diseases; Kruskal Wallis test; machine learning; major clinical study; middle aged; natural science; outpatient; physiological stress; poverty; race; regression analysis; regression model; sample size; socioeconomics; statistical analysis; Texas; epidemiology; male; mental disease; psychology; United States; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Socioeconomic Factors,,,,,,This research was funded in part by a generous gift from the Marek Family.,"Nguyen, Phi Yen, Effect of nature prescriptions on cardiometabolic and mental health, and physical activity: a systematic review, The Lancet Planetary Health, 7, 4, pp. e313-e328, (2023); Yau, Katherine Ka Yin, Effects of forest bathing on pre-hypertensive and hypertensive adults: A review of the literature, Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine, 25, 1, (2020); Birch, Jo, Nature doesn't judge you – how urban nature supports young people's mental health and wellbeing in a diverse UK city, Health and Place, 62, (2020); de Bell, Siân, Spending time in the garden is positively associated with health and wellbeing: Results from a national survey in England, Landscape and Urban Planning, 200, (2020); Remme, Roy P., An ecosystem service perspective on urban nature, physical activity, and health, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 22, (2021); Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States Results from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, (2020); Mwoka, Meggie, Housing as a Social Determinant of Health: Evidence from Singapore, the UK, and Kenya: the 3-D Commission, Journal of Urban Health, 98, pp. 15-30, (2021); Prokosch, Christopher, Exploring associations between social determinants of health and mental health outcomes in families from socioeconomically and racially and ethnically diverse households, Preventive Medicine, 161, (2022); Feng, Xiaoqi Qi, The nexus between urban green space, housing type, and mental health, Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 57, 9, pp. 1917-1923, (2022); Gonzales-Inca, Carlos A., Residential greenness and risks of depression: Longitudinal associations with different greenness indicators and spatial scales in a Finnish population cohort, Health and Place, 74, (2022)","J.E.

There is an optimum design value for the sky openness and the street enclosure, which need to be balanced with shade while meeting the light of the road. And it is also important to provide appropriate visual permeability. Furthermore, unlike daily activities, it was found that higher function mixture and function density did not have significant positive effects on the road running intensity.

While empirical studies, not least in Space Syntax research, have used explanatory statistical models to identify spatial parameters influencing pedestrian movement, these models face limitations in forecasting pedestrian flows in future or data-scarce areas. Thus, they are not as useful for scenario analysis, assessment and decision making in urban design and planning. Pedestrian route-choice models are equally challenging as they are highly data demanding and depend on predictors too detailed for early design and planning stages. Instead of complex models, this study proposes a parsimonious predictive model based on street network modelling and a few spatial predictors that can be easily defined and calculated during early project stages. The paper outlines the methodology and results of the model, which employs LASSO regression in machine learning to predict numbers of pedestrians at the street segment level. The model is trained using data gathered in Stockholm and is first tested by predicting full-day pedestrian counts at street segments of central Gothenburg. The model is evaluated both in relation to predicting the absolute number of pedestrians and their relative distribution within the area. This concise yet effective model shows promising results for early forecast of pedestrian flows in development plans and infrastructural changes and can offer a valuable tool for planners and designers to influence and optimise the distribution of pedestrian flows in various urban contexts. © 14th International Space Syntax Symposium, SSS 2024.",Machine learning; Pedestrian flows; planning; Predictive modelling; Space syntax; Urban design,Prediction models; Urban growth; Design and planning; Machine-learning; Pedestrian flow; Pedestrian movement; Predictive models; Space syntax; Street segments; Sustainable mobility; Urban design; Urban development; Syntactics,,,,,,,"Basu, Rounaq, How do street attributes affect willingness-to-walk?

However, the effective integration of solar energy into urban landscapes faces challenges in spatial planning, resource optimisation, and stakeholder engagement. This literature review addresses the existing gaps by systematically evaluating Geographic Information System (GIS)-based methodologies for PV potential assessment and rooftop solar energy planning. It aims to provide the knowledge necessary for supporting efficient and sustainable solar energy adoption in cities. This chapter involved a systematic review and synthesised the diverse body of knowledge regarding city-scale rooftop solar energy planning. The goal was to identify the technical challenges, highlight the trends, and reveal opportunities for future research initiatives with respect to the evolving needs of sustainable energy planning. Employing a dual-method systematic approach, this review utilised both quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques. Through the quantitative survey, a generic corpus (805 studies) of Scientometrics using CiteSpace was built, ensuring a broad representation of the existing literature. In parallel, a qualitative survey, evaluating literature associated with solar rooftop PV assessment using GIS, modelling techniques, planning implications, and recommendations, led to a critical corpus (76 studies) using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) method. Spanning the past two decades and drawing from databases of Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), the synthesised corpora formed the foundation for a comprehensive and informed evaluation. Additionally, analytical assessment criteria were developed to provide insights into future research agendas and framework. The literature synthesis unveiled the challenges within urban energy planning, covering issues of data accuracy, model validation, and imperative stakeholder engagement. Emerging trends in GIS models, especially the integration of machine learning and three-dimensional (3D) mapping, emphasise the dynamic nature of the urban environment. Furthermore, applications of GIS in real-world urban contexts provide spatially explicit insights for future implementations.

This paper explores the fascinating intersection of art and architecture through the application of neural style transfer algorithms to urban landscapes and architectural compositions. Traditional image editing procedures or hand painting represent examples of style transfer methods with severe limitations. When applying style transfer to architectural images, structural details may be lost due to an overemphasis on artistic style, leading to unrealistic texture application and visual incoherence. Color distortion and the risk of the style overpowering the architectural content further compound these challenges. Additionally, inadequate hyperparameters may result in a loss of contextual understanding, where the algorithm fails to grasp architectural significance, leading to visually confusing compositions. In this work, various pre-trained models of CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) and their hyperparameters are compared. The study aims to evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters, such as style weight, content weight, and learning rate, on the quality and fidelity of stylized images. By systematically varying these hyperparameters and analyzing their effects on the output images, this research aims to identify the optimal combination that maximizes style transfer fidelity while preserving content details. Content preservation, geometric distortion, artifact reduction, and visual quality are important criteria for comparison. Metrics like the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structural Similarity Index (SSI), and others are used to statistically assess these properties. The research attempts to determine the best pre-trained CNN model and the best hyperparameters for style transfer that are most suitable for architectural images. © 2024 IEEE.",Convolutional Neural Network; Deep learning; Image style transfer; Pre-trained models,Deep neural networks; Image analysis; Image texture; Risk assessment; Architectural images; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Hyper-parameter; Image editing; Image style transfer; Innovative techniques; Pre-trained model; Transfer method; Urban landscape; Convolutional neural networks,,,,,,,"Jing, Yongcheng, Neural Style Transfer: A Review, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 26, 11, pp. 3365-3385, (2020); A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, (2015); Qiao, Yingxu, Efficient Style-Corpus Constrained Learning for Photorealistic Style Transfer, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 30, pp. 3154-3166, (2021); Preserving Color in Neural Artistic Style Transfer, (2016); Gatys, Leon A., Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 2414-2423, (2016); Corr, (2016); Improving the Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, (2016); Zhang, Yexun, A Unified Framework for Generalizable Style Transfer: Style and Content Separation, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 29, pp. 4085-4098, (2020)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"15th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies, ICCCNT 2024",2024-06-24 through 2024-06-28,Kamand,203877,,9.80E+12,,,English,"Int.

UAVs offer unique advantages over stationary traffic cameras, including greater flexibility in monitoring large and dynamic urban areas. However, detecting small, densely packed vehicles in UAV imagery remains a significant challenge due to occlusion, variations in lighting, and the complexity of urban landscapes. Conventional models often struggle with these issues, leading to inaccurate detections and reduced performance in practical applications. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CFEMNet, an advanced deep learning model specifically designed for high-precision vehicle detection in complex urban environments. CFEMNet is built on the High-Resolution Network (HRNet) architecture and integrates a Context-aware Feature Extraction Module (CFEM), which combines multi-scale feature learning with a novel Self-Attention and Convolution layer setup within a Multi-scale Feature Block (MFB). This combination allows CFEMNet to accurately capture fine-grained details across varying scales, crucial for detecting small or partially occluded vehicles. Furthermore, the model incorporates an Equivalent Feed-Forward Network (EFFN) Block to ensure robust extraction of both spatial and semantic features, enhancing its ability to distinguish vehicles from similar objects. To optimize computational efficiency, CFEMNet employs a local window adaptation of Multi-head Self-Attention (MSA), which reduces memory overhead without sacrificing detection accuracy. Extensive experimental evaluations on the UAVDT and VisDrone-DET2018 datasets confirm CFEMNet’s superior performance in vehicle detection compared to existing models. This new architecture establishes CFEMNet as a benchmark for UAV-enabled traffic management, offering enhanced precision, reduced computational demands, and scalability for deployment in smart city applications. The advancements presented in CFEMNet contribute significantly to the evolution of smart city technologies, providing a foundation for intelligent and responsive traffic management systems that can adapt to the dynamic demands of urban environments. © 2024 The Authors.

Students developed urban design concepts from initial ideas to visual prototypes, promoting creativity and collaboration. The research investigates the role of VGI in the ideation process and its potential as a participatory tool for urban regeneration. Collage, reappropriated as a collaborative technique, works alongside generative AI to aid in creating and refining ideas. Additionally, the study presents a method for creating before- and-after images, providing a dynamic way to visualise urban evolution. Through an analysis of student feedback and project outcomes, the study identifies both the benefits and limitations of using generative AI in design education, aiming to improve AI interfaces and their application in collaborative design contexts. The findings suggest that VGI can impact design thinking and practice, serving as both a creative tool and a means to facilitate inclusive and insightful decision-making processes. © 2024, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

Accurate surface information is crucial for various urban planning and climate studies. The diverse use of artificial materials and mixed pixels complicates spectral analysis for multispectral and hyperspectral sensors, requiring higher resolution for identification. Moreover, existing hyperspectral libraries using spectroradiometers, lack the necessary variability required for effective Machine Learning model training. To address these gaps, the urbisphere urban hyperspectral library is under development, leveraging the spectroradiometer Spectral Evolution RS-3500. The library enables satellite image classification without the need for time-consuming on-site data collection.

The advancement of artificial intelligence has substantially increased convenience for individuals. This research proposes an urban landscape layout model powered by artificial intelligence that automatically generates urban landscape design based on deep learning (URDDL) with two dimensions: emotional tendency and urban landscape appraisal. The input image represents land use and surrounding road conditions, while the output image depicts the selection of the main entrance and the internal spatial function layout. The Pix2Pix model is trained to learn the internal function layout based on varying land use and road conditions. Additionally, a domain-specific dictionary is constructed using an existing semantic resource vocabulary, where positive and negative sentiment words are compared with their corresponding sentiment values, focusing on categories such as Stimulate, Sense, and Action. Experimental results indicate that the absolute average error of the URDDL model is 91.31%, with a maximum error of 96.87%. The degree of fit is highly appropriate for evaluating the emotional prediction of urban landscapes. The findings demonstrate that the URDDL model outperforms traditional design methods regarding generated results, suggesting its potential for future applications in automated landscape design. © (2024), (PeerJ Inc.).

Maintaining roads in optimal condition necessitates regular and thorough inspections, which can be both costly and resource-intensive. This study introduces a novel approach to monitoring road conditions by employing a fusion strategy that combines camera and instance segmentation techniques, enabling precise pothole identification and mapping within the urban landscape. In our research, we have evaluated the performance of four iterations of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm (YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) for the detection and characterisation of potholes. The systems were trained using publicly available datasets. Our findings reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each YOLO version in pothole detection tasks, with a surprising outcome: YOLOv5 demonstrates superior performance over its more recent successors. This work not only provides a feasible solution for continuous and automated road condition monitoring but also offers a comparative analysis of cutting-edge detection technologies, contributing valuable insights for future urban infrastructure maintenance strategies. © 2024 IEEE.",machine learning; machine vision; Pothole detection,Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Pedestrian safety; Condition; Condition evaluation; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Machine-vision; Performance; Pothole detection; Road condition; Urban road; Vision information; Machine vision,,,,,(FB0008),We would like to thank to the National Robotarium and the AC3E FB0008,"Lee, Sang Yum, Prediction and detection of potholes in urban roads: Machine learning and deep learning based image segmentation approaches, Developments in the Built Environment, 13, (2023); Salcedo, Edwin, A Novel Road Maintenance Prioritisation System Based on Computer Vision and Crowdsourced Reporting, Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks, 11, 1, (2022); Varona, Braian, A deep learning approach to automatic road surface monitoring and pothole detection, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 24, 4, pp. 519-534, (2020); Bibi, Rozi, Edge AI-Based Automated Detection and Classification of Road Anomalies in VANET Using Deep Learning, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2021, (2021); Chibani, Noureddine, Road anomaly detection using a dynamic sliding window technique, Neural Computing and Applications, 34, 21, pp. 19015-19033, (2022); Ochoa-Ruiz, Gilberto Tillán, An asphalt damage dataset and detection system based on retinanet for road conditions assessment, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 11, (2020); Gupta, Saksham, Detection and localization of potholes in thermal images using deep neural networks, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 79, 35-36, pp. 26265-26284, (2020); Ukhwah, Ernin Niswatul, Asphalt Pavement Pothole Detection using Deep learning method based on YOLO Neural Network, pp. 35-40, (2019); Park, Sungsik, Application of various yolo models for computer vision-based real-time pothole detection, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 23, (2021); Aparna, Convolutional neural networks based potholes detection using thermal imaging, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 34, 3, pp. 578-588, (2022)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Aksaray University; IEEE,"4th IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer, and Energy Technologies, ICECET 2024",2024-07-25 through 2024-07-27,Sydney,203204,,9.80E+12,,,English,"Int.

Departing from linear processes, the text embraces a comprehensive perspective, acknowledging the multidimensional factors shaping urban landscapes. The integration of AI in urban design takes cues from the way neural networks operate, dynamically responding to real-time data inputs and historical iterations. Historical reference points, from Renaissance ideal cities to Modernism, serve as repositories guiding the interrogation of urban morphology. The reasoning behind the text navigates the complexities of urban planning, emphasizing the role of humanities in crafting inclusive, meaningful designs. The interrogation delves into the historical intricacies, from Alberti’s Ideal City to Simmel’s analysis of metropolitan existence, whilst scrutinizing modernist movements like Dada, cubism, and futurism and contrasting them with antiurban ideologies in the works of Howard, Taut, and Wright. This chapter then transitions to the contemporary landscape, portraying AI’s disruptive moment in art and design. Drawing parallels with the modernist explosion, it discusses the dichotomy between organic, hands-on creation, and AI-driven, data-informed methodologies. The tension between technological precision and human creativity is explored, cautioning against the risk of detaching art from visceral experiences. The integration of AI in urban design is examined, emphasizing its potential in prediction, optimization, and generative design. AI’s capacity to process vast amounts of data is highlighted, offering evidence-based insights and breaking free from traditional design molds. This chapter concludes by underscoring the ethical considerations of AI in urban design, emphasizing the need for human intuition to complement computational insights and safeguard principles of equity and social justice. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Mitra Kanaani individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,,"Carpo, Mario, The Digital Turn in Architecture 1992–2012, pp. 1-264, (2015); Automate Software Citation Using Gitcite, (2019); Modern City Planning in the 19th Century, (1969); Ludwig Hilberseimer Reanimating Architecture and the City, (2023); Crawford, Kate, Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1-327, (2021); Cuthbert, Alexander Rankine, The Form of Cities: Political Economy and Urban Design, pp. 1-304, (2008); Neural Architecture Design and Artificial Intelligence, (2022); Engineering International, (2017); Garden Cities of to Morrow, (1965); Esteva, Andre, Deep learning-enabled medical computer vision, npj Digital Medicine, 4, 1, (2021)",,,Taylor and Francis,,,,,,,9781032469904; 9781040107775,,,English,"The Routledge Companion to Smart Design Think. in Architecture & Urbanism for a Sustainable, Living Planet",Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206698914

The escalating concerns of air quality in densely populated urban landscapes like Delhi, underscore the need for effective interventions. As urbanization and population growth exacerbate environmental issues, the deterioration of air quality becomes a paramount threat. This study explores how artificial intelligence can play a pivotal role in proactively managing air quality. The research evaluates the performance of three forecasting models for predicting PM2.5 and Air Quality Index (AQI) in Alipur, Delhi, India: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous variables (SARIMAX). Our analysis indicates that the Bi-LSTM model outperformed the others, demonstrating a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0411 for PM2.5 and 0.0754 for AQI. This research not only highlights the effectiveness of AI models in capturing intricate temporal patterns but also emphasises their significance in formulating preemptive measures during episodes of poor air quality. © 2024 IEEE.",Air Quality Index; Environmental Monitoring; LSTM; PM2.5; SARIMAX; Time Series Regression,Air quality; Air quality standards; Population statistics; Air quality forecasting; Air quality indices; Bi-directional; Environmental Monitoring; Exogenous variables; Pm2.5; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variable; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages; Short term memory; Time-series regression,,,,,,,"Air Pollution, (1989); Biogeochemistry, (2020); WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines Particulate Matter Pm2 5 and Pm10 Ozone Nitrogen Dioxide Sulfur Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide, (2021); Sahu, Shovan K., Significance of PM2.5 air quality at the Indian capital, Aerosol and Air Quality Research, 17, 2, pp. 588-597, (2017); Xing, Yufei, The impact of PM2.5 on the human respiratory system, Journal of Thoracic Disease, 8, 1, pp. E69-E74, (2016); National Air Quality Index; Mishra, Rajeev Kumar, The effect of odd-even driving scheme on PM 2.5 and PM 1.0 emission, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 67, pp. 541-552, (2019); Journal of Environmental and Public Health, (2023); Selokar, Ashish W., PM 2.5 particulate matter and its effects in Delhi/NCR, Materials Today: Proceedings, 33, pp. 4566-4572, (2020); Sankar Ganesh, S., Forecasting air quality index using regression models: A case study on Delhi and Houston, 2018-January, pp. 248-254, (2017)","V.

Real estate pricing is a nuanced arena influenced by a gamut of socioeconomic elements, neighbourhood facilities, and the changing dynamics of urban spaces. Utilising the H4M dataset, which merges various data sources and viewpoints, this research embarks on a comparative analysis of seven primary machine learning methods. These include linear regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, CatBoost, random forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) regressor, and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model. Considerations span from property aesthetics to traffic nuances and the pulse of public sentiment. Among the models, random forest notably emerges with an impressive accuracy, reinforcing its robustness in the real estate prediction domain.

BUAs often exhibit detailed textures and structures in high-resolution imagery but also present strong heterogeneity. Current methods for BUA extraction primarily relied on planar information from single-view imagery, struggling to effectively capture the 3-D attributes of urban landscapes. Therefore, to address this challenge, this article proposes a cross-angle propagation network (CAPNet) based on multiview remote sensing stereo observation imagery. Our contributions are threefold: 1) we propose the cross-angle fusion module (CAFM) to exploit BUA's complementary spatial-spectral-angular context across different viewing angles. This module leverages attention mechanisms for the automated acquisition of multiangle feature representation learning from diverse angle combinations. 2) We propose a multiangular propagation decoder (MAPD) that pioneers the exploration of gradually propagating multiangle disparity information through bidirectional-adjacent feature fusion across hierarchical levels. 3) We construct a large-scale, high-resolution multiview BUA (MVBA) dataset over China's 41 major cities based on the ZY-3 satellites. Extensive experiment results on MVBA and the public WV-3 multiview semantic stereo datasets verify CAPNet's superiority to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, on preserving overall BUA shape, edge, and internal structures.

The method begins with the extraction of deep functions, utilising the combined spectral-spatial statistics, accompanied by means of class through a tender-choice classifier. A selection-level fusion mechanism similarly refines these classifications, integrating the consequences of numerous fashions to decorate usual accuracy.

Big data from social media has become a new way to perceive city image characteristics. Taking Nanjing (China) as a case study, we use social media data from the 'Little Red Book' and 'Sina Weibo' (similar to Twitter in China) and employ deep learning methods, multisource data semantic analysis, sDNA, and geographically weighted regression to analyze three aspects: the spatial distribution of hotspots, perception characteristics, and influencing factors. The hotspots are located in Nanjing's old city, centered on Confucius Temple, and extend outward in a circular pattern. Regarding perception characteristics, the key characteristics that define the old city are 'heritage monuments', 'long history', and 'culture'. The high functional perception area converged around the central urban area. The spatial distributions of closeness and betweenness under traffic perception showed opposite trends; emotional perception was mainly positive. Compared with visual and emotional perception, functional and traffic perception have greater impacts on city image hotspots. Our study constructs a model of city image perception from a new perspective. This approach bridges the gap that traditional city image research focuses only on objective environment descriptions and lacks subject-object relationship analysis, which can provide scientific value for decision makers in urban design management. © 2013 IEEE.",big data; City image; Nanjing; social media; spatial perception,Urban planning; City image; Cognition; Nanjing; Social factor; Social media; Social networking (online); Social-networking; Space explorations; Spatial perception; Spatial resolution; Urban areas; Decision making,,,,,"National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (22FYSB02); (KYCX23_1203); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202308320338); (164120281)","\u201C This work was supported in part by the National Social Science Fund project, grant number 22FYSB02; Jiangsu Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program project, grant number KYCX23_1203); China Scholarship Council: 202308320338; Jiangsu University Advantageous Discipline Construction Project, grant number 164120281\u201D.","Nasar, Jack Leon, The Evaluative Image of the City, Journal of the American Planning Association, 56, 1, pp. 41-53, (1990); Su, Lei, Exploring City Image Perception in Social Media Big Data through Deep Learning: A Case Study of Zhongshan City, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 4, (2023); City Reader, (2015); Complexity Cognition Urban Planning and Design, (2016); Image of the City, (1960); Filomena, Gabriele, A computational approach to ‘The Image of the City’, Cities, 89, pp. 14-25, (2019); Cities of the Mind, (1984); Carmona, Matthew, Public places urban spaces: The dimensions of urban design, pp. 1-672, (2021); Architecture and Civil Engineering, (2007); Scientia Geographica Sinica, (2005)","H.

Short-term load forecasting (STLF) emerges as a pivotal tool in the decision-making processes underlying the day-to-day operation and planning of modern power grids. It has become an indispensable component of efficient energy management systems. While existing literature has extensively explored STLF using conventional statistical methods such as ARIMA and advanced deep learning techniques like LSTM, CNN, and Transformer architectures, these studies often lack a comprehensive examination of these methodologies across multiple short-term forecast horizons. In this study, leveraging historical hourly electrical load data from Kinshasa, we employ popular statistical models such as ARMA alongside advanced deep learning architecture LSTM to identify the most effective model for horizons t+1 (very short-term), t+12, and t+24, Our comparative analysis shows that ARMA model has the best MAPE for t+1, but LSTM exhibit superior performance for longer forecast horizons. These findings suggest the necessity of employing a diverse array of models, each specifically tailored to a specific forecast horizon, to formulate an optimal forecasting policy crucial for resilient energy management in dynamic urban landscapes. © 2024 IEEE.",ARMA; LSTM; Multi-horizon forecasting; Short-Term load forecasting,Electric load forecasting; Population statistics; ARMA; Comparative analyzes; Electrical load forecasting; Energy; LSTM; Multi-horizon forecasting; Neural-networks; Short term load forecasting; Short-term electrical loads; Statistic modeling,,,,,,,"Journal of Electrical Systems and Information Technology, (2020); Bendaoud, Nadjib Mohamed Mehdi, Using deep learning for short-term load forecasting, Neural Computing and Applications, 32, 18, pp. 15029-15041, (2020); Interpretable Short Term Load Forecasting Via Multi Scale Temporal Decomposition, (2024); Azeem, Abdul, Electrical Load Forecasting Models for Different Generation Modalities: A Review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 142239-142263, (2021); Sievers, Jonas, Secure short-term load forecasting for smart grids with transformer-based federated learning, pp. 229-236, (2023); Electrical Load Forecasting Model Using Hybrid Lstm Neural Networks with Online Correction, (2024); Yin, Chunlin, SARIMA-Based Medium- and Long-Term Load Forecasting, Strategic Planning for Energy and the Environment, 42, 2, pp. 283-306, (2023); Abumohsen, Mobarak, Electrical Load Forecasting Using LSTM, GRU, and RNN Algorithms, Energies, 16, 5, (2023); Zhao, Yumeng, A Differential Privacy-enhanced Federated Learning Method for Short-Term Household Load Forecasting in Smart Grid, pp. 1399-1404, (2021); Delgado Fernandez, Joaquin, Privacy-preserving federated learning for residential short-term load forecasting, Applied Energy, 326, (2022)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"7th IEEE International Symposium on Measurements and Networking, M and N 2024",2024-07-02 through 2024-07-05,Rome,201550,,9.80E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Providentially, advancements in Deep learning has the potential to address this problem with various methods to implement adaptive traffic system. However, such solutions require large amounts of infrastructural expenditure to establish the connectivity of all intersections of a large road network. Although, such enormous investments have given only a few preliminary successes. In this paper, a cloud-based adaptive traffic control and management system that utilizes a set of Cloud services offered by a very well-known Cloud provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Amazon Kinesis, a serverless flowing data service which streamlines the process of capturing, data processing and storing data streams, Amazon Rekognition, a high-powered video analysis service, for real-time detection and counting, Amazon Lambda and other services is proposed. This system can detect and count vehicles with more accuracy and optimizes the signal time by a custom-made algorithm to reduce overall travel time. This proposed system also helps emergency vehicles from being impassable by other vehicles during stop phase, reduce vehicular emission at intersections with minimal cost of setup. © 2024 IEEE.",adaptive traffic signal; Amazon Web Services; congestion control; detection; Emergency Vehicle Bypass; intelligent traffic management; Vehicular Traffic,Adaptive control systems; Data handling; Deep learning; Information management; Quality of service; Street traffic control; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Web services; Websites; Adaptive traffic signal; Amazon web services; Cloud-based; Congestion control; Detection; Emergency vehicle bypass; Intelligent traffic management; Traffic management; Urban landscape; Vehicular traffic; Traffic signals,,,,,,,"Ait Abdelali, Hamd, Multiple hypothesis detection and tracking using deep learning for video traffic surveillance, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 164282-164291, (2021); Alonazi, Mohammed, A Smart Traffic Control System Based on Pixel-Labeling and SORT Tracker, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 80973-80985, (2023); Won, Myounggyu, Intelligent Traffic Monitoring Systems for Vehicle Classification: A Survey, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 73340-73358, (2020); Wang, Zhiyuan, A Robust Vehicle Detection Scheme for Intelligent Traffic Surveillance Systems in Smart Cities, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 139299-139312, (2020); Bermudez, Ignacio N., A distributed architecture for the monitoring of clouds and CDNs: Applications to Amazon AWS, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 11, 4, pp. 516-529, (2014); Abdelwahab, Mohamed A., Reliable and rapid traffic congestion detection approach based on deep residual learning and motion trajectories, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 182180-182192, (2020); Zhang, Bo, A Traffic Surveillance System for Obtaining Comprehensive Information of the Passing Vehicles Based on Instance Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 22, 11, pp. 7040-7055, (2021); Zhu, Jiasong, Urban Traffic Density Estimation Based on Ultrahigh-Resolution UAV Video and Deep Neural Network, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 11, 12, pp. 4968-4981, (2018); Zhao, Jiandong, Traffic speed prediction under non-recurrent congestion: based on lstm method and beidou navigation satellite system data, IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine, 11, 2, pp. 70-81, (2019); Tang, Yong, Vehicle detection and recognition for intelligent traffic surveillance system, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 76, 4, pp. 5817-5832, (2017)","S.

This demand is further amplified by the anticipated impacts of climate change and the complexities introduced by rapidly expanding urban populations. In this scenario, smart city initiatives have emerged as a pivotal strategy to address these challenges, leveraging innovative technologies and paradigms such as Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science to improve the quality of urban life in a more sustainable way. Recently, research efforts in these domains have focused on creating systems that can adapt and respond to changing conditions, enabling greater adaptivity and responsiveness to the needs of urban landscapes. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive survey of adaptive urban services within a smart city context. Through analyses of recent literature, we investigate the technological foundations that enable the adaptivity of urban services and explore their applications in various urban scenarios, including energy, mobility, emergency management, public safety, and waste management. This article also highlights the benefits of adopting adaptive urban services, such as improved traffic management, resilient emergency management, and enhanced citizen engagement, bringing an important contribution to this broad research area. Finally, we provide a discussion on current technology enablers and challenges and present an overview for future research directions on adaptive urban systems at the forefront of transforming cities into more intelligent ecosystems. © 2013 IEEE.",adaptivity; artificial intelligence; data science; Internet of Things; Smart cities,Artificial intelligence; Civil defense; Climate change; Disasters; Information management; Risk management; Smart city; Urban planning; Waste management; Adaptivity; Artificial data; Emergency management; Innovative technology; Public infrastructures; Public services; Urban areas; Urban population; Urban services; Urban systems; Internet of things,,,,,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","This work was supported in part by INEGI and in part by national funds through the FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC), under the RELIABLE project PTDC/EEI-AUT/3522/2020 (DOI 10.54499/PTDC/EEI-AUT/3522/2020), the Associate Laboratory Advanced Production and Intelligent Systems \u2013 ARISE LA/P/0112/2020 (DOI 10.54499/LA/P/0112/2020) and the Base Funding (UIDB/00147/2020) and Programmatic Funding (UIDP/00147/2020) of the R&D Unit Center for Systems and Technologies \u2013 SYSTEC.","Singh, Tarana, A Decade Review on Smart Cities: Paradigms, Challenges and Opportunities, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 68319-68364, (2022); Kirimtat, Ayca, Future Trends and Current State of Smart City Concepts: A Survey, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 86448-86467, (2020); Pourzolfaghar, Zohreh, Standardisation of enterprise architecture development for smart cities, Journal of the Knowledge Economy, 11, 4, pp. 1336-1357, (2020); Zaidi, Syed Ali Raza, Unlocking Edge Intelligence Through Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), IEEE Access, 10, pp. 100867-100877, (2022); Enlund, Desiree, The role of sensors in the production of smart city spaces, Big Data and Society, 9, 2, (2022); Arora, Anuja, Next Generation of Multi-Agent Driven Smart City Applications and Research Paradigms, IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society, 4, pp. 2104-2121, (2023); Sharif, Abida, Internet of Things network cognition and traffic management system, Cluster Computing, 22, pp. 13209-13217, (2019); Khan, Asif, Multiscale modeling in smart cities: A survey on applications, current trends, and challenges, Sustainable Cities and Society, 78, (2022); Du, Rong, The Sensable City: A Survey on the Deployment and Management for Smart City Monitoring, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 21, 2, pp. 1533-1560, (2019); Lilhore, Umesh Kumar, Design and Implementation of an ML and IoT Based Adaptive Traffic-Management System for Smart Cities, Sensors, 22, 8, (2022)","J.C.N.

Its classification as a science, a non-science (i.e., an art), or both, remains a widely debated topic in the field. This paper presents at least three reasons why urban design can be treated as a science (not an art) in particular fields, such as population health, which require more objective tools and indicators: the importance of systematic data analysis, the emphasis on evidence-based decisions and assessments, and the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration. This scientific perspective enables urban design to more effectively address public health challenges in built environments. Further, the paper proposes key future directions to enhance the scientific approach to urban design in relation to population health. These include the development of standardised terminology and metrics, the application of data-driven technologies such as geospatial artificial intelligence, the establishment of science-based urban design codes and policies, and the enhancement of urban design education through scientific research methods. These steps are essential to advance the scientific understanding of urban design’s impact on health. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",Art; Built environment; Evidence; Population health; Science-based urban design,,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (23K09701, 20H04113); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS",Koohsari is supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (Grant 23K09701).

The aim was to rate and contrast these models' accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to identify which will be appropriate for those who are analyzing images to classify geographical and natural environments. In this study, the datasets, which were extracted from an online repository known as Kaggle, were used to train both models and they were evaluated using the structured methodology that entails data preprocessing, model training including hyperparameter optimization and performance evaluation. The outcome projected that EfficientNet was better than MobileNetV2 in all the metrics, providing the highest accuracy but with a balanced precision-recall and f1-scores criteria.

These structures are equipped with advanced sensors, actuators, and control systems to optimize energy utilization while ensuring occupant comfort and operational efficiency. Central to this paradigm is energy modeling, a process that entails the analysis and prediction of energy consumption patterns within building environments. Efficient energy modeling holds paramount significance for devising effective strategies to mitigate energy wastage, reduce operational costs, and minimize environmental footprints. This research presents a novel approach, the Hierarchical Deep Learning Framework for Multi-scale Energy Modeling in Smart Building Environments, aimed at enhancing energy modeling efficiency. The Deep Energy Fusion (DEF) algorithm is introduced by integrating Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) with a hierarchical energy modeling architecture. DEF leverages DBNs' capability to learn complex hierarchical representations of energy data across various scales, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of energy consumption patterns. To evaluate DEF's performance, the simulation analysis are conducted by comparing it with existing algorithms. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R^2) are employed to assess prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate that DEF outperforms traditional algorithms in capturing both local and global dependencies within the energy data, thereby improving energy modeling accuracy. Moreover, DEF showcases superior performance in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.

For many, these tools are especially helpful in wading through, distilling, and prioritizing the large economic, social, and environmental datasets that are available for urban sites and for revealing proposals not typically considered in non-generative urban design processes. Some think that generative tools have the power to shift the funda-mental role of the urban designer but at the same time, there are concerns about the potential loss of designer agency. This study is based on the premise that it is necessary to critically evaluate emerging tools like those employed in generative design before they are widely adopted into mainstream practice. Thus, with this work, we studied the role of one generative tool – Spacemaker1 – to better understand the potential challenges and benefits of integrating these techniques into design workflows. We found that, in its current form, this tool cannot replace the detailed work of designers but can, instead, assist them to think outside of the box and with mundane, repetitive tasks. Furthermore, we found promise in a more hybridized future with a co-created design process. © 2024, VDE VERLAG GMBH.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated proficiency in various computer vision tasks, positioning them as promising tools for automated VQoSS assessment. In this paper, we pioneer the application of MLLMs to VQoSS change estimation, with our empirical findings affirming their effectiveness. In addition, we introduce Street Quality Generative Pre-trained Transformer (SQ-GPT), a model that distills knowledge from the current most powerful but inaccessible (not free) GPT-4V, requiring no human efforts. SQ-GPT approaches GPT-4V's performance and is viable for large-scale VQoSS change estimation. In a case study of Nanjing, we showcase the practicality of SQ-GPT and knowledge distillation pipeline. Our work promises to be a valuable asset for future urban studies research. © 2013 IEEE.",deep learning; multimodal large language models; Smart city; visual quality,Deep learning; Distillation; Image analysis; Modal analysis; Modeling languages; Pipelines; Quality control; Smart city; Sustainable development; Context models; Image color analysis; Language model; Multi-modal; Multimodal large language model; Space change; Task analysis; Visual qualities; Visual languages,,,,,,,"Mouratidis, Kostas, Urban planning and quality of life: A review of pathways linking the built environment to subjective well-being, Cities, 115, (2021); Liu, Tsung Jung, Study of visual quality assessment on pattern images: Subjective evaluation and visual saliency effects, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 61432-61444, (2018); Meyrick, Kate, Exploring the potential connection between place capital and health capital in the post COVID-19 city, npj Urban Sustainability, 3, 1, (2023); Sharifi, Ayyoob, The COVID-19 pandemic: Impacts on cities and major lessons for urban planning, design, and management, Science of the Total Environment, 749, (2020); Tang, Jingxian, Measuring visual quality of street space and its temporal variation: Methodology and its application in the Hutong area in Beijing, Landscape and Urban Planning, 191, (2019); Song, Lei, The Fine Design Strategy of Urban Streets Using Deep Learning With the Assistance of the Internet of Things, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 67518-67525, (2023); Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, (1980); Balogun, Abdul Lateef, Assessing the Potentials of Digitalization as a Tool for Climate Change Adaptation and Sustainable Development in Urban Centres, Sustainable Cities and Society, 53, (2020); Biljecki, Filip, Street view imagery in urban analytics and GIS: A review, Landscape and Urban Planning, 215, (2021); Wang, Moyang, Assessing Street Space Quality Using Street View Imagery and Function-Driven Method: The Case of Xiamen, China, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 11, 5, (2022)","J.

This paper presents a novel approach for analyzing nocturnal urban noise patterns and identifying distinct zones using mobile phone data. Traditional noise-monitoring methods often require specialized equipment and are limited in scope. Our methodology involves gathering audio recordings from city sensors and localization data from mobile phones placed in urban areas over extended periods with a focus on nighttime, when noise profiles shift significantly. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the developed system processes the audio data to extract noise features indicative of different sound sources and intensities. These features are correlated with geographic location data to create comprehensive city noise maps during nighttime hours. Furthermore, this work employs clustering algorithms to identify distinct noise zones within the urban landscape, characterized by their unique noise signatures, reflecting the mix of anthropogenic and environmental noise sources. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using mobile phone data for nocturnal noise analysis and zone identification. The derived noise maps and zones identification provide insights into noise pollution patterns and offer valuable information for policymakers, urban planners, and public health officials to make informed decisions about noise mitigation efforts and urban development. © 2023 by the authors.",clustering algorithms; machine learning; mobile phone sensing; noise patterns; urban environments,,,,,,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/00315/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","This work was supported by the Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e Tecnologia under Grant [UIDB/00315/2020]; and by the project \u201CBLOCKCHAIN.PT (RE-C05-i01.01\u2014Agendas/Alian\u00E7as Mobilizadoras para a Reindustrializa\u00E7\u00E3o, Plano de Recupera\u00E7\u00E3o e Resili\u00EAncia de Portugal\u201D in its component 5\u2014Capitalization and Business Innovation and with the Regulation of the Incentive System \u201CAgendas for Business Innovation\u201D, approved by Ordinance No. 43-A/2022 of 19 January 2022).","Wu, Kang, The Influence of New-Type Urbanization and Environmental Pollution on Public Health: A Spatial Durbin Model Study, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 23, (2023); Conference Noise and Air Pollution Challenges and Opportunities Noise Pollution Human Health A Review, (2017); Sun, Congting, Urbanization and residents’ health: from the perspective of environmental pollution, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 30, 25, pp. 67820-67838, (2023); Asdrubali, Francesco, Innovative Approaches for Noise Management in Smart Cities: a Review, Current Pollution Reports, 4, 2, pp. 143-153, (2018); Pita, Antonio, Cluster analysis of urban acoustic environments on barcelona sensor network data, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 16, (2021); Fredianelli, Luca, Traffic Flow Detection Using Camera Images and Machine Learning Methods in ITS for Noise Map and Action Plan Optimization, Sensors, 22, 5, (2022); Alías-Pujol, Francesc, Review of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks for Environmental Noise Monitoring in Smart Cities, Journal of Sensors, 2019, (2019); Liu, Ye, Internet of things for noise mapping in smart cities: State of the art and future directions, IEEE Network, 34, 4, pp. 112-118, (2020); López Navarro, Juan Manuel, A digital signal processor based acoustic sensor for outdoor noise monitoring in smart cities, Sensors, 20, 3, (2020); Licitra, Gaetano, Acoustic Beamforming Algorithms and Their Applications in Environmental Noise, Current Pollution Reports, 9, 3, pp. 486-509, (2023)","J.A.

Conventional traffic signal systems often falter in adapting to evolving traffic dynamics, compromising road network efficiency. To address this a novel paradigm—a smart traffic control system leveraging advanced computer technology is proposed. This system employs real-time monitoring and analysis to dynamically adjust traffic signals, optimizing traffic flow, and mitigating congestion-related adversities. The integration of deep learning and computer vision technologies is used to enable a nuanced understanding of visual data and patterns. Remarkably, the YOLO tool is utilized to enhance the system’s capacity to swiftly identify emergency vehicles and give them priority. The proposed system is designed to efficiently handle traffic density and includes features for prioritizing emergency vehicles. Furthermore, it employs a non-uniform allocation of waiting times to lanes, which is contingent upon real-time traffic density and patterns.

In the course of time, they reveal structural alterations therein that may be a consequence of climate change. Capturing such visual data rapidly to make them available to citizens, professionals, and policymakers promotes awareness and assists decision making for action. We applied unsupervised Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the analysis of a time series of satellite images using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). The Quantization Error (QE) in the map output is exploited as an indicator of change. Given the proven sensitivity of this neural network metric to intensity and polarity of image pixel contrast, and its proven selectivity to pixel colour, it is shown to capture critical changes in the water levels of Lake Mead across the years 1984–2008. The SOM-QE analysis is combined with statistical trend analysis to further highlight the magnitude and the direction of pixel contrast changes in specific regions of interest. We show that the structural change in the Lake Mead region is significantly correlated with demographic data for the same reference time period, translating the impact of human activities on the local environment. The results of this study show the usefulness of SOM-QE analysis as a parsimonious and reliable AI approach to the analysis of minimally pre-processed satellite images for rapid detection of environmental degradation as a consequence of human activities and climate change. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Change; Climate Change; Landscapes; Public Data; Quantization Error; Satellite Images; Self Organizing Map (SOM); Structures; Water Levels,Climate change; Conformal mapping; Decision making; Image analysis; Image compression; Lakes; Pixels; Satellites; Self organizing maps; Time series analysis; Change; Human activities; Lake meads; Landscape; Public data; Quantization errors; Satellite images; Self organizing map; Self-organizing-maps; Visual data; Water levels,,,,,,,"Orheim, Olav, Investigating climate change by digital analysis of blue ice extent on satellite images of Antarctica, Annals of Glaciology, 14, pp. 211-215, (1990); Furusawa, Takuro, Time-series analysis of satellite imagery for detecting vegetation cover changes in Indonesia, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Rosin, Paul L., Evaluation of global image thresholding for change detection, Pattern Recognition Letters, 24, 14, pp. 2345-2356, (2003); Matlab Implementations and Applications of the Self Organizing Map, (2014); Wandeto, John Mwangi, SOM-QE ANALYSIS: A biologically inspired technique to detect and track meaningful changes within image regions[Formula presented], Software Impacts, 17, (2023); Liu, Rongrong, Spatiotemporal Modeling of Grip Forces Captures Proficiency in Manual Robot Control, Bioengineering, 10, 1, (2023); Transactions on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence, (2021); Dresp-Langley, Birgitta, Human symmetry uncertainty detected by a self-organizing neural network map, Symmetry, 13, 2, pp. 1-15, (2021); Surgical Task Expertise Detected by A Self Organizing Neural Network Map, (2021); Dresp-Langley, Birgitta, Pixel precise unsupervised detection of viral particle proliferation in cellular imaging data, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 20, (2020)","B.

This research addresses the critical need for an efficient system to monitor and mitigate air pollution using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The problem statement revolves around the urgency to curb rising pollution levels in cities, necessitating a comprehensive monitoring and control mechanism. The proposed method involves deploying a WSN infrastruc-ture strategically across urban zones to collect real-time air quality data. These networks consist of interconnected sensors capable of measuring various pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Data collection is processed using advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to predict pollution trends and identify high-risk areas. Additionally, the system integrates actuators for prompt mitigation, allowing for immediate response to pollution spikes by activating interventions like air purifiers or traffic rerouting. The flow of the project begins with the deployment and calibration of sensor nodes across the urban landscape. These nodes continuously gather data, feeding it to a central control system for analysis. Advanced algorithms assess the data, providing actionable insights and triggering mitigation strategies when pollution thresholds are exceeded. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in real-time pollution monitoring and timely intervention. The system shows cases with improved air quality in monitored areas, leading to a reduction in health-related issues and environmental degradation. Furthermore, the system’s scalability and adaptability make it a promising solution for urban sustainability initiatives worldwide. © 2024, Scibulcom Ltd.

Adopting advanced artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies, this paper successfully constructs a 3D visualization scene of the urban landscape, which provides a vivid and intuitive perspective for urban planning. Further, based on the planning and design framework of urban landscape ecosystem, this paper clarifies the ecological evaluation elements and landscape design indexes, and uses VR technology to optimize the design of environmental aspects of urban streets. By establishing an optimization strategy database, this paper conducts an in-depth correlation analysis between the optimization scheme's design indicators and evaluation factors. Comparing the comprehensive ecosystem service area before and after optimization, the results show that applying VR technology in ecological landscape design is highly effective. The integrated ecosystem service area before and after optimization increased from 7611.72m2 to 8039.51m2, of which the integrated ecosystem service area of “general” grade increased by 324.03m2, showing the best effect of ecological optimization.

However, these images have seldom been utilized in urban research due to challenges in labelling (collecting training samples), having only a single panchromatic band and classification. To tackle these limitations, this paper focuses on developing a multi-stage reconstructed historical fine-scale urban landscape (RHFUL) pipeline for KH-9 HEXAGON MCS. The proposed pipeline first integrates internalized parameters, hierarchical object-based image analysis properties and class variability to synthesize new features, abbreviated to IHC. Second, the pipeline uses a weak semi-automated supervised labelling (WSSL) approach to acquire training samples. Finally, the training samples and generated features are subjected to the SegNet deep learning architecture. The performance of each step was assessed against corresponding state-of-the-art benchmark approaches for each of synthesizing features, labelling and classification. In the proposed RHFUL pipeline, the proposed IHC provided the most salient information for urban classification, WSSL labelled urban features more accurately, and the SegNet architecture classified more accurately the urban features relative to the benchmarks. Considering the potential advantages, but also limitations of KH-9 HEXAGON MCS images, further research should be undertaken, particularly drawing on the current advances in pattern recognition techniques for contemporary digital satellite sensors. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",deep learning; historical urban landscape; KH-9 HEXAGON; labelling; mapping camera system (MCS); synthesizing features,Benchmarking; Cameras; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Image reconstruction; Mapping; Pattern recognition; Sampling; Camera systems; Fine-scale; Historical urban landscape; Keyhole-9 HEXAGON; Labelings; Mapping camera; Mapping camera system; Synthesizing feature; Urban landscape; Pipelines; algorithm; image classification; mapping method; urban ecosystem; China; Hangzhou; Zhejiang,,,,,(2022AH051126),This research was supported by Key Projects of Natural Science Research Projects in Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province (2022AH051126).

Built environments are formed from the combination and juxtaposition of visible and invisible environmental variables. In recent years, common techniques such as virtual reality, augmented reality, digital twins, and artificial intelligence have enabled researchers in the field of architecture and urban design to simulate environmental conditions to investigate the impacts of environmental variables on humans. However, the studies conducted in this field of human comfort are mostly focused on the impact of environmental variables such as form, temperature, humidity, and sound, and in fewer studies, up-to-date methods and technologies have been used to simulate and investigate the impact of smell on humans. Most of the studies that have investigated the effect of ambient smell on humans, carried out in the discipline of architecture and urban design, have used traditional tools and methods (questionnaire, interview, observation) rather than advanced technology and tools drawing on neuroscientific knowledge and technique to measure the effectiveness of the ambient smell on human. They have used unmasked scents or real-world environments rather than being able to simulate environmental conditions. This article highlights the significance and necessity of employing simulation methods to investigate the impact of environmental smells on humans. Additionally, it presents the methodology of an experiment for studying the effect of indoor environment smells (with a case study of an office environment in the initial phases) on human emotions, utilizing a mixed-method approach. Analysis of some parts of the data from this experiment showed that exposure to the fragrance of the jasmine flower pleasant (flower) and the odor of the rotten orange peel (unpleasant) can cause changes in the electroencephalography (EEG) power across different bands among participants. © The Author(s) 2024.",Ambient smell; Built environment; Electroencephalography; Neuroarchitecture; Physiological signals; Simulation methods,Behavioral research; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Neurophysiology; Odors; Virtual reality; Ambient smell; Ambients; Architecture designs; Built environment; Environmental variables; Human emotion; Mixed method; Neuroarchitecture; Physiological signals; Simulation method; Augmented reality,,,,,,,"Backx, Rosa, Comparing web-based and lab-based cognitive assessment using the cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery: A within-subjects counterbalanced study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 22, 8, (2020); Characterisation of an Existing Building According to Olfactory Parameters, (2002); Invisible Architecture Experiencing Places Through the Sense of Smell, (2006); Blum, Austin W., Neurocognitive Functioning in Young Adults with Subclinical Body Dysmorphic Disorder, Psychiatric Quarterly, 89, 1, pp. 45-52, (2018); Smell of Memory Sensorial Mnemonics, (2006); Le Theatre De La Memoire Olfactive Le Pouvoir Des Odeurs A Modeler Notre Perception Spatio Temporelle De L Environnement, (2013); Infolio, (2021); Boyce, J.

However, in the studies of actual UTCI, datasets are mostly obtained from on-site measurement data or simulation data, which is costly and ineffective. So, how to efficiently and rapidly conduct a large-scale and fine-grained outdoor environmental comfort evaluation based on the outdoor environment is the problem to be solved in this study. Compared to the conventional qualitative analysis methods, the rapidly developing algorithm-supported data acquisition and machine learning modelling are more efficient and accurate. Goodfellow proposed Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) in 2014, which can successfully be applied to image generation with insufficient training data. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) to predict UTCI in traditional blocks. 36000 data samples were obtained from the simulations, to train a pix2pix model based on the TensorFlow framework. After more than 300 thousand iterations, the model gradually converges, where the loss of the function gradually decreases with the increase of the number of iterations. Overall, the model has been able to understand the overall semantic information behind the UTCI graphs to a high degree. Study in this paper deeply integrates the method of data augmentation based on GAN and machine learning modeling, which can be integrated into the workflow of detailed urban design and sustainable construction in the future. © The Author(s) 2024.",Data augmentation; GAN; Machine learning; UTCI,Data acquisition; Semantics; Sustainable development; Bottom up; Climate index; Data augmentation; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Outdoor thermal comfort; Residential neighborhoods; Science and Technology; Thermal; Universal thermal climate index; Generative adversarial networks,,,,,,,"Naboni, Emanuele, A digital workflow to quantify regenerative urban design in the context of a changing climate, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 113, (2019); Khodadadi, Narges, Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Ahvaz, Iran, Reproductive Health, 19, 1, (2022); Cai, Wenjia, The 2022 China report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: leveraging climate actions for healthy ageing, The Lancet Public Health, 7, 12, pp. e1073-e1090, (2022); Liu, Kuixing, A machine learning approach to predict outdoor thermal comfort using local skin temperatures, Sustainable Cities and Society, 59, (2020); Shah, Rishika, Urban physics and outdoor thermal comfort for sustainable street canyons using ANN models for composite climate, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 61, 12, pp. 10871-10896, (2022); Ravuri, Suman V., Skilful precipitation nowcasting using deep generative models of radar, Nature, 597, 7878, pp. 672-677, (2021); Huang, Chenyu, Accelerated environmental performance-driven urban design with generative adversarial network, Building and Environment, 224, (2022); Fiala, Dusan, UTCI-Fiala multi-node model of human heat transfer and temperature regulation, International Journal of Biometeorology, 56, 3, pp. 429-441, (2012); Błażejczyk, Krzysztof, An introduction to the Universal thermal climate index (UTCI), Geographia Polonica, 86, 1, pp. 5-10, (2013); Havenith, George, The UTCI-clothing model, International Journal of Biometeorology, 56, 3, pp. 461-470, (2012)","X.

The objective was to provide insights beneficial for landscape design, urban planning, and the creation of more appealing and sustainable lake parks. To achieve this, two primary methods were employed in this study: the Automated Machine Learning (Auto ML) model and the DeepLab v3+ model. To gather data for the research, 46,444 images were collected from 20 different lake parks from 2019 to 2022. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Flickr, and specific lake park community groups were tapped to source photographs from both professional photographers and the general public. According to the experimental findings, the perceived frequency of natural landscapes was 69.27%, which was higher than that of humanistic landscapes by 30.73%. The perceived intensity was also maintained between 0.09 and 0.25. The perceived frequency of water body landscapes was much greater on a macro-scale, at 73.02%, and the public had various plant preferences throughout the year. Aquatic plant landscapes with low-to-medium green visibility were preferred by the public, according to the landscape share characterization, while amusement rides with medium-to-high openness were preferred. The sky visibility of amusement rides was between 0 and 0.1 and between 0.3 and 0.5, indicating that the public preferred amusement rides with medium-to-high openness. In lake parks, the populace chose settings with less obvious architectural features. When combined, the two models used in this study are useful for identifying and analyzing the intended traits and preferences of lake parks among the general public. They also have theoretical and practical application value for directing the development of lake parks and urban landscapes. © 2024 by the authors.",auto ML modeling; imagery features; lake parks; public perceived preferences,experimental study; image analysis; image classification; machine learning; park management; perception; public sector,,,,,"Pukyong National University, PKNU",This work was supported by the Pukyong National University Research Fund in 2021.,"Barma, Modu, Multiobjective Mathematical Optimization Model for Municipal Solid Waste Management with Economic Analysis of Reuse/Recycling Recovered Waste Materials, Journal of Computational and Cognitive Engineering, 1, 3, pp. 122-137, (2022); Kim, Doeun, Differences in Perceptions of Naturalness among Urban Park User Groups in Seoul, International Review for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development, 10, 4, pp. 112-129, (2022); Shen, Shiguang, Quantitative study on landscape colors of plant communities in urban parks based on natural color system and M-S theory in Nanjing, China, Color Research and Application, 47, 1, pp. 152-163, (2022); Li, Jie, Effects of the spatial patterns of urban parks on public satisfaction: evidence from Shanghai, China, Landscape Ecology, 38, 5, pp. 1265-1277, (2023); Ding, Caichang, Identification effect of least square fitting method in archives management, Heliyon, 9, 9, (2023); J Urban Manag Energy Sustain, (2023); Zheng, Lingyan, Long-memory retention and self-powered ultraviolet artificial synapses realized by multi-cation metal oxide semiconductors, Journal of Materials Chemistry C, 11, 21, pp. 7098-7105, (2023); Jahani, Ali, Landscape aesthetic quality assessment of forest lands: an application of machine learning approach, Soft Computing, 27, 10, pp. 6671-6686, (2023); Nakarmi, Ganga, A crowdsource approach to documenting users' preferences for landscape attributes in the proposed Appalachian Geopark Project in West Virginia, United States, International Journal of Geoheritage and Parks, 11, 2, pp. 310-327, (2023); Egarter Vigl, Lukas, Harnessing artificial intelligence technology and social media data to support Cultural Ecosystem Service assessments, People and Nature, 3, 3, pp. 673-685, (2021)","D.

Recent progress in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) presents promising solutions for addressing this limitation. To accomplish prompt and accurate flood mapping in complex urban areas from high-resolution remote sensing images to support disaster management and response, this study makes contributions in three key aspects: weak training data generation, the improvement of WSSS algorithm, and the construction of benchmark datasets. Firstly, we present a novel yet efficient weak training data generation strategy by decoupling the acquisition of positive and negative samples. This strategy enables the rapid generation of block-level weak annotations assisted by pre-flood river data or the segment anything model (SAM) for zero-shot segmentation, thereby alleviating the burden of weak data labeling. Secondly, to enhance the flood detection results in complex urban landscapes based on low-cost weak labels, we design an end-to-end WSSS framework incorporating tree filtering-based structure constraints and a perturbed dual-branch cross self-distillation mechanism. Lastly, to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we constructed two large aerial imagery datasets, namely Calgary-Flood and Huston-Flood. These datasets encompass diverse urban land covers and include challenging scenarios with extensive shadows, providing a robust benchmark for evaluating our method against various urban environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our weak data annotation strategy substantially enhances efficiency. Additionally, the proposed WSSS framework exhibits superior performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of edge delineation and algorithmic stability. The advancements in weak data annotation strategy, end-to-end model architecture, and benchmark dataset development in this study collectively exploit the potential of the weakly supervised paradigm for rapid flood mapping in urgent situations.

Satellite images captured during daytime have customarily served as the primary resource for this extraction process. However, the emergence of Nighttime Light (NTL) remote sensing data introduces an innovative dimension to this arena. The exploration of NTL data for road extraction remains in its nascent stage, and this study seeks to bridge this gap. We present a refined U-Net model (CA U-Net) integrated with Cross-Attention Mechanisms, meticulously designed to extract roads from Yangwang-1 NTL images. This model incorporates several enhancements, thereby improving its proficiency in identifying and delineating road networks. Through extensive experimentation conducted in the urban landscape of Wenzhou City, the model delivers highly accurate results, achieving an F1 score of 84.46%. These outcomes significantly surpass the performance benchmarks set by Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the Optimal Threshold (OT) method. This promising development paves the way towards maximizing the utility of NTL data for comprehensive mapping and analysis of road networks. Furthermore, the findings underscore the potential of utilizing Yangwang-1 data as a reliable source for road extraction and reaffirm the viability of deploying deep learning frameworks for road extraction tasks utilizing NTL data. ©: © 2024 Zhu et al.

Uniquely, our workflow operates entirely unsupervised, eliminating the need for any training procedures. We have integrated a specially tailored digital terrain model generation algorithm into our workflow to prevent errors in complex urban landscapes, especially around highways and overpasses. Through fine rasterization of LiDAR point clouds, we have enhanced building-tree differentiation. In addition, we have reduced errors near water bodies and augmented computational efficiency by introducing a new planarity calculation. Our workflow offers a practical and scalable solution for the mass production of rasterized 2D and 3D building maps from raw airborne LiDAR data. Our method's robustness has been rigorously validated across a diverse dataset in comparison with deep learning-based and hand-digitized products. Through these extensive comparisons, we provide a valuable analysis of building maps generated via different methodologies.

To fill this gap, this study uses deep learning-based methods to extract visitors' movement trajectories (n = 18,592) from a time-lapse video of a promenade in Hong Kong. The trajectories are classified into different groups based on a set of movement indicators. Multinomial logistic regression is used to examine the relationship between trajectory types and the level of interaction with different site features. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is also used to compare the average amount of physical activity among different trajectory types. The results show that interaction with semi-fixed or movable site features is associated with higher odds of people having “playful” trajectories than other types of trajectories. People with “sporty” trajectories and “playful” trajectories on average have the highest amount of physical activity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Physical activity; Play; Public space; Urban design,machine learning; open space; physical activity; regression analysis; urban design; Article; controlled study; Hong Kong; human; movement (physiology); pilot study; playing; public health; public open space; space; sport; videorecording; analysis of variance; environment; exercise; statistical model; China; Analysis of Variance; Environment; Exercise; Humans; Logistic Models; Sports,,,,,"(2020B1212030009); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (GRF17616221)",Funding text 1: This work was supported by Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Grant Number: GRF17616221) and the 2020 Guangdong Science and Technology Department (Grant Number: 2020B1212030009).

J., Faculty ITC, Universiteit Twente, Enschede, Overijssel, Netherlands; Vosselman, George, Faculty ITC, Universiteit Twente, Enschede, Overijssel, Netherlands","Semantic segmentation has recently emerged as a prominent area of interest in Earth observation. Several semantic segmentation datasets already exist, facilitating comparisons among different methods in complex urban scenes. However, most open high-resolution urban datasets are geographically skewed toward Europe and North America, while coverage of Southeast Asia is very limited. The considerable variation in city designs worldwide presents an obstacle to the applicability of computer vision models, especially when the training dataset lacks significant diversity. On the other hand, naively applying computationally expensive models leads to inefficacies and sometimes poor performance. To tackle the lack of data diversity, we introduce a new UAVPal dataset of complex urban scenes from the city of Bhopal, India. We complement this by introducing a novel dense predictor head and demonstrate that a well-designed head can efficiently take advantage of the multiscale features to enhance the benefits of a strong feature extractor backbone. We design our segmentation head to learn the importance of features at various scales for each individual class and refine the final dense prediction accordingly. We tested our proposed head with a state-of-the-art backbone on multiple UAV datasets and a high-resolution satellite image dataset for LULC classification. We observed improved intersection over union (IoU) in various classes and up to 2$\%$ better mean IoU. Apart from the performance improvements, we also observed nearly 50$\%$ reduction in computing operations required when using the proposed head compared to the traditional segmentation head. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",CNN; deep learning; Earth observstion (EO); semantic segmentation; vision transformer,Classification (of information); Deep learning; Job analysis; Land use; Semantic Segmentation; Computational modelling; Earth observstion; Features extraction; Head; Semantic segmentation; Task analysis; Urban areas; Vision transformer; Semantics; data set; EOS; land classification; land cover; land use; machine learning; segmentation; urban area; Bhopal; Europe; India; Madhya Pradesh; North America; Southeast Asia,,,,,,,"Wang, Xiaolei, A deep learning method for optimizing semantic segmentation accuracy of remote sensing images based on improved UNet, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); A Review on Deep Learning Techniques Applied to Semantic Segmentation, (2017); Mehta, Dushyant, Simple and Efficient Architectures for Semantic Segmentation, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2022-June, pp. 2627-2635, (2022); Vision Transformer Adapter for Dense Predictions, (2022); Deng, Xueqing, Scale aware adaptation for land-cover classification in remote sensing imagery, pp. 2159-2168, (2021); Chen, Liangchieh, Encoder-decoder with atrous separable convolution for semantic image segmentation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11211 LNCS, pp. 833-851, (2018); Badrinarayanan, Vijay, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition, (2014); Xie, Enze, SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 15, pp. 12077-12090, (2021); Lin, Tsungyi, Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8693 LNCS, PART 5, pp. 740-755, (2014)","A.

We used a total of 117,259 GPS points and 160 person-day data points for elderly individuals living in Uijeongbu-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The differences in the walking environments selected based on the walking purpose were analyzed using a random forest method, and the nonlinear relationship was investigated. In addition, an in-depth analysis was performed by adopting an interpretation approach from global and local perspectives. The findings highlight the significance of walking street pleasure and network properties for leisure walking. Specifically, a green area ratio of 15 % or more positively relationship path choice for leisure, underscoring the importance of sufficient green space. Conversely, the high proportion of green areas typically has negative implications for commercial walking. Road connectivity and integration are predominantly negatively associated with route choice for leisure, indicating a decreased preference for highly integrated roads during leisure walking activities. These findings provide valuable insights for an evidence-based urban design strategy to make walkable environments. It can contribute to urban planning and policy, particularly the development of tailored walkable environments for the older population. © 2023 The Authors",Built environment; Interpretable Machine learning; Non-linear association; Random forest; The elderly; Walking behaviors,Forestry; Leisure; Urban planning; Built environment; Interpretable machine learning; Linear associations; Machine-learning; Non linear; Non-linear association; Random forests; The elderly; Urban design; Walking behavior; Machine learning; aging population; elderly population; greenspace; machine learning; urban planning; urban policy; urban population; walking; Kyonggi; South Korea,,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2022R1F1A1075136); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (Ministry of Science and ICT) (No. 2022R1F1A1075136 ).,"Abbott, Robert D., Walking and dementia in physically capable elderly men, JAMA, 292, 12, pp. 1447-1453, (2004); Adadi, Amina, Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); Alidoust, Sara, Talking while walking: an investigation of perceived neighbourhood walkability and its implications for the social life of older people, Journal of Housing and the Built Environment, 33, 1, pp. 133-150, (2018); Barredo-Arrieta, Alejandro, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, Information Fusion, 58, pp. 82-115, (2020); Ball, Kylie, Perceived environmental aesthetics and convenience and company are associated with walking for exercise among Australian adults, Preventive Medicine, 33, 5, pp. 434-440, (2001); Baobeid, Abdulla Mohamed, Walkability and Its Relationships With Health, Sustainability, and Livability: Elements of Physical Environment and Evaluation Frameworks, Frontiers in Built Environment, 7, (2021); Bassett, David R., Walking, cycling, and obesity rates in Europe, North America and Australia, Journal of Physical Activity and Health, 5, 6, pp. 795-814, (2008); van den Berg, Pauline E.W., Locations that support social activity participation of the aging population, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 12, 9, pp. 10432-10449, (2015); Böcker, Lars, Elderly travel frequencies and transport mode choices in Greater Rotterdam, the Netherlands, Transportation, 44, 4, pp. 831-852, (2017); Borst, Hieronymus C., Relationships between street characteristics and perceived attractiveness for walking reported by elderly people, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 28, 4, pp. 353-361, (2008)","L.

There is also the issue of new build, both in relation to resource conservation but also in general.

Among the models used are: YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once), and an enhanced model for using in object detection of the infrastructure status. For the exposure and testing of the models, which delineates building, roads and other civil infrastructure features, a new dataset of Bangladesh was employed. The results confirmed that M2-d modeled improvement in detection accuracy across all the algorithms, but with an inefficiency variant. We observed that YOLOv8 and the proposed custom model demonstrated impressive performance in modeling the spatial and temporal differences of infrastructures. The models are used for temporal dynamics tracking and making adjustments to urban design predictions on temporal scales.

The study investigates two case studies: Perugia, Italy, and Oslo, Norway. Utilizing street-level imagery processed through semantic segmentation, the research quantifies the urban environment using metrics such as the Green View Index (GVI), Sky View Factor (SVF), and Building View Factor (BVF). Perugia, with its historical architecture and compact medieval urban fabric, reveals a concentration of greenery in peripheral zones, with limited green visibility in its dense city center. In contrast, Oslo displays a more uniform integration of green spaces, ensuring high accessibility even within its central urban areas. These disparities reflect differing urban histories, geographic layouts, and planning approaches, emphasizing the challenges of achieving equitable green space distribution in varied contexts. The findings underscore the pivotal role of green spaces in promoting psychological and physical health by mitigating urban stress and enhancing relaxation. The study also highlights the constraints of utilizing proprietary data sources such as Google Street View, advocating for the development of open-access and equitable data frameworks. This research contributes to the field by proposing a scalable and transferable AI-driven methodology for urban landscape evaluation. The results provide actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers aimed at fostering sustainable and livable cities. © 2024 University of L'Aquila, Department of Civil Construction, Building and Architecture, Environmental Engineering.

However, curing the problem of landscape ecological security is an important part of Homeland security, economic and social sustainable development. We must deal with the relationship between high-quality social development and ecological environment protection on the basis of scientific evaluation. To address this issue, research has provided better data support for feature extraction through image preprocessing. Then the Convolutional neural network in deep learning is trained through a large number of collected measured data. Finally, the pressure state response model is used to evaluate the ecological security of the healing landscape. The results show that the average error of the ground class in 2010 was 13.65%, and the fitting accuracy reached 86.35%, indicating that this method has high accuracy and can be effectively applied in evaluation. Meanwhile, in 2010 and 2019, the average landscape ecological security levels of City A were 7.27 and 6.65, both at a 'safe' level, but the overall security level showed a downward trend. It is recommended to optimize the land use pattern in future urban planning and construction, improve the urban landscape ecological security index value, and maintain consistency with the actual situation of the city. This can provide reference for the evaluation model of urban landscape ecological security, and further provide scientific basis and guidance for the ecological civilization construction of urban agglomerations. In subsequent research, the evolution trend of urban landscape ecological security can be taken as the research goal, and finally, guidance on optimizing urban landscape ecological security can be provided. © 2023 - IOS Press.

A UHI is a city or town area exhibiting a temperature variance from its surrounding environment. Researchers employ various relative UHI parameters to model UHI data and predict temperature fluctuations. For the study area of Srinagar City, Jammu & Kashmir, India, land surface temperature (LST) data and its correlated parameters were sourced from satellite imagery. The LST data for the region were analyzed to understand the development and investigate the UHI effect and its variations. Utilizing an 8-day revisit period during the busiest season month, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite provided LST data from 2001 to 2021. To address the large dataset, which includes 16 samples of LST data per square kilometer each year measured in Kelvin (K), different machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to establish associations for UHI modeling. These clusters were then compared with established scientific categories in the study area. The long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) model, using time-series data, predicted changes in urbanized areas, vegetation cover, wetlands, and other factors. For land use land cover (LULC) prediction, the neural network (NN) model outperformed all others, with Regression (R) = 0.897, Validation = 0.912, and Training = 0.931, and mean squared error (MSE) = 2.012, Validation = 0.191, and Training = 1.124. This paper strives to identify and analyze the relationship between LULC change and LST variations in the context of urbanization. Initially, it examines the correlations between LST and variables such as vegetation, man-made structures, and agriculture, employing built-up indices within each LULC category and vegetation cover. Subsequently, it assesses the impacts of LULC change and urbanization on UHI using hot spot and urban landscape analyses. Finally, it proposes a model employing non-parametric regression to predict future urban climate trends, considering anticipated changes in land cover and land use. © 2023 Mujtaba Shafi et al.",Land surface temperature; Land use land cover; Machine learning; Urban heat islands,,,,,,,,"1st International Student Research Conference 2020 Dhaka Bangladesh, (2020); Dar, Ilyas, Estimation of LST from multi-sensor thermal remote sensing data and evaluating the influence of sensor characteristics., Annals of GIS, 25, 3, pp. 263-281, (2019); Environmental Challenges, (2021); Journal of Computational Environmental Sciences, (2015); Linking People Place and Policy, (2002); Qiao, Zhi, Influences of urban expansion on urban heat island in Beijing during 1989-2010, Advances in Meteorology, 2014, (2014); Shao, Bin, Prediction and visualization for urban heat island simulation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6758, pp. 1-11, (2011); Naim, Md Nazmul Huda, Assessment of urban thermal field variance index and defining the relationship between land cover and surface temperature in Chattogram city: A remote sensing and statistical approach, Environmental Challenges, 4, (2021); Zhou, Ji, Modelling the diurnal variations of urban heat islands with multi-source satellite data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 34, 21, pp. 7568-7588, (2013); Oke, Timothy R., The energetic basis of the urban heat island, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 108, 455, pp. 1-24, (1982)","M.

This paper presents a methodology for the unsupervised classification of Casablanca's land cover using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The study exploits multispectral satellite imagery, in particular Landsat data, to extract meaningful land-use classes without the need for manual labeling. The workflow includes data collection, pre-processing, unsupervised clustering, and visualization of results. By applying the k-means and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) clustering algorithms, the city's land area is divided into distinct clusters, each representing a specific land-use class. The resulting land-use map provides valuable information on Casablanca's urban landscape, highlighting forest areas, crops, built-up infrastructure, water bodies, and barren areas. This automated approach demonstrates the potential of GEE as a powerful tool for land use analysis, enabling effective, data-driven decision-making for urban development and environmental monitoring. The methodology presented can serve as a basis for similar studies in other regions, contributing to the advancement of remote sensing and geospatial analysis techniques for urban and environmental studies. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these two algorithms in terms of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The K-means algorithm recorded moderate accuracy. The LVQ algorithm, on the other hand, performed the least well. © Geoinformatics International.",Google Earth Engine; Land Cover; Machine Learning; Satellite Image; Unsupervised Classification,algorithm; comparative study; land cover; land use; Landsat; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; unsupervised classification; Casablanca [Morocco]; Morocco,,,,,,,"AbuAlghanam, Orieb, Enhancing the Speed of the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) Algorithm by Adding Partial Distance Computation, Cybernetics and Information Technologies, 22, 2, pp. 36-49, (2022); Ali, Ishfaq, Model Selection Using K-Means Clustering Algorithm for the Symmetrical Segmentation of Remote Sensing Datasets, Symmetry, 14, 6, (2022); Artelt, André, Efficient computation of counterfactual explanations of LVQ models, pp. 19-24, (2020); Çelik, Turgay, Unsupervised change detection in satellite images using principal component analysis and κ-means clustering, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 6, 4, pp. 772-776, (2009); Irdp Institut De Recherche Et De Documentation Pedagogique, (2023); Duda, Tanja, Unsupervised classification of satellite imagery: Choosing a good algorithm, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 23, 11, pp. 2193-2212, (2002); Duro, Dennis C., A comparison of pixel-based and object-based image analysis with selected machine learning algorithms for the classification of agricultural landscapes using SPOT-5 HRG imagery, Remote Sensing of Environment, 118, pp. 259-272, (2012); Gascon, Mireia, Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a marker of surrounding greenness in epidemiological studies: The case of Barcelona city, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 19, pp. 88-94, (2016); Gorelick, Noel S., Google Earth Engine: Planetary-scale geospatial analysis for everyone, Remote Sensing of Environment, 202, pp. 18-27, (2017); Heydarian, Mohammadreza, MLCM: Multi-Label Confusion Matrix, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 19083-19095, (2022)","H.

Increasing urbanization throughout the Anthropocene has led to the rise of the urban landscape (‘urbanscape’) as a globally dominant habitat. Though historically less developed, similar urbanization patterns are emerging in the boreal forest, the world's largest forest ecoregion. Here we evaluate the ecological position of migratory Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) in a subarctic urbanscape. We attempt to investigate a summer niche swap theory, in which gulls annually fill a vacant niche otherwise occupied by common ravens in winter. For that investigation we conducted seasonal plot surveys for Short-billed Gull presence from 2013 to 2016 in the Fairbanks, AK municipality. All data were made publicly available. We compiled them in a open source and ESRI geographic information system (GIS) platform and then added 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic U.S. Census data. We trained, tested, and evaluated the performance of an ensemble of machine learning models, resulting in predictions of gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots, at 100-m resolution for inference. We find that Short-billed Gulls prefer the synergy of industrial areas near man-made water bodies, impervious surfaces, gravel pits, strip malls, transfer sites (garbage dumps) and some young forest vegetation. This study is a first-known attempt to utilize a blended ‘Big Data’ approach, in combination with traditional multi-year field-based data collection and alternative model assessments, in order to characterize an urban seabird niche.

While landscape metrics have been widely used to reflect land use spatial patterns, the association between the morphological spatial pattern of urban land and pluvial floods is much less understood. Unlike landscape metrics, morphological spatial pattern analysis could discover more spatial information on the formation and layout of land use. To fill such knowledge gap, this research evaluated whether the morphological characteristics of urban land matter to pluvial floods based on machine learning techniques. Pearson's correlation test and random forest algorithm were employed to discover the linear and non-linear associations between the density of flood hotspots and a set of underlying influencing factors, respectively. A case study in a low-lying coastal city has highlighted the strong influence of land use morphological characteristics on pluvial floods with baseline influencing factors considered. The density of flood hotspots was positively associated with the core, loop, edge, and bridge of urban land at sub-watershed level, but negatively associated with islet urban land. While it is unfeasible to restrain rapid urban sprawl and population growth in many developing countries, this research could give specific guidance for upgrading the morphological spatial pattern of urban land. A proper design of key morphological elements may overcome the negative influence of urban expansion on pluvial floods. These findings could help urban planners and policy makers to highlight the importance of land use morphological spatial patterns. © 2023",Morphological spatial pattern; Random forest; Stormwater management; Urban landscape; Urban pluvial flood; Waterlogging,Correlation methods; Developing countries; Forestry; Land use; Machine learning; Population statistics; Urban growth; Landscape metric; Morphological characteristic; Morphological spatial pattern; Pluvials; Random forests; Spatial patterns; Stormwater managements; Urban landscape; Urban pluvial flood; Waterlogging; Floods; coastal zone; developing world; flood; land use; machine learning; population growth; spatial analysis; stormwater; urban design; urban morphology; urban sprawl; waterlogging,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41801307); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (GD23XSH11); Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project, (202201010289); National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, (202311078003); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2023A1515030300)","This study was funded by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Grant No. 2023A1515030300 ), National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (Grant No. 202311078003 ), Guangdong Philosophy and Social Science Foundation (Grant No. GD23XSH11), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41801307 ), and Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project (Grant No. 202201010289 ).","Bi, Shibo, The impact of urban green space morphology on PM2.5 pollution in Wuhan, China: A novel multiscale spatiotemporal analytical framework, Building and Environment, 221, (2022); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Bruwier, M., Influence of urban pattern on inundation flow in floodplains of lowland rivers, Science of the Total Environment, 622-623, pp. 446-458, (2018); Cao, Weiwei, Influential factors affecting protective coping behaviors of flood disaster: A case study in Shenzhen, China, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 16, pp. 1-15, (2020); Chakrabortty, Rabin, Flash-flood hazard susceptibility mapping in Kangsabati River Basin, India, Geocarto International, 37, 23, pp. 6713-6735, (2022); Chang, Heejun, Assessment of urban flood vulnerability using the social-ecological-technological systems framework in six US cities, Sustainable Cities and Society, 68, (2021); Chen, Ming, Effects of urban green space morphological pattern on variation of PM2.5 concentration in the neighborhoods of five Chinese megacities, Building and Environment, 158, pp. 1-15, (2019); Chen, Yangbo, Urban flood risk warning under rapid urbanization, Environmental Research, 139, pp. 3-10, (2015); da Silva, Lucas Borges Leal, A novel spatiotemporal multi-attribute method for assessing flood risks in urban spaces under climate change and demographic scenarios, Sustainable Cities and Society, 76, (2022); Dai, Fei, Spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 concentration at the neighborhood level in five Chinese megacities, Atmospheric Pollution Research, 11, 6, pp. 190-202, (2020)","J.

However, previous studies have mostly predominantly focused on individual perceptions of greenway landscapes, rather than considering the integrated visual characteristics of both the inner and the visible surroundings. This disparity often deviates from people's actual perception of these spaces. To address this gap, we have adopted a new approach to identify the integrated greenway visual characteristics in inner and surrounding landscapes from a human perception perspective, in the city of Wuhan, China. Our methodology involved the utilization of deep learning systems, text semantic analysis, and other techniques to integrate multi-source data, including street view images, remote sensing images, and perceptual comments, to quantitatively assess the landscape sequences and naturalness of landscape changes along the greenway paths. We identify the positions and characteristics of unique landscape nodes within the greenway. The findings of our study revealed ten main landscape types of greenways in Wuhan, with over 72 % of the greenways comprising more than five types. As the length of the greenways increases, the number of landscape types initially experiences rapid growth before reaching a stable state. Furthermore, the frequency of landscape change exhibits a linear and positive correlation with greenway length. Notably, the naturalness of the majority of greenway inner landscapes closely aligns with that of the surrounding visible environment. The openness of all greenways was positively correlated with the proportion of farmland and grassland in their surrounding areas. Furthermore, people exhibit higher positive sentiment responses to greenways that maintain a high level of natural consistency between the inside and outside environments. Additionally, over 47 % of the unique nodes primarily coincide with a specific landscape type and play a vital role in shaping the rhythm of greenway landscape change.

To refer to the management direction of protected areas, various studies have been conducted to identify users' perspectives and find their needs. This study aimed to propose a method to analyze the landscapes perceived by users in Taeanhaean National Park and their spatial distribution by applying crowdsourced photos created and uploaded based on user experiences, Google Vision API, Latent Dirichlet allocation, and the self-organizing map (SOM) machine learning technique. According to the results, Taeanhaean National Park contains 12 major landscape types that include coastal landscapes, forest landscapes, sand dunes, horizontal land landscapes, and urban landscapes. Using crowdsourced photo data, this study was able to identify landscape types that were unrecognized from the perspective of experts or officials and was also able to map the distribution of each landscape type based on the photos' location information. Furthermore, this study aimed to derive the major bases of several landscape types in the large study area through SOM analysis. By using social media data to analyze users’ preferences and perceptions of national parks and large protected areas, this study proposed a potential indicator for a user-participatory landscape monitoring system. Management implications: This study aims to help formulate a management plan considering users’ preferences and perceptions of protected areas using crowdsourced photo data. In the analysis stage, an unsupervised learning method, a type of machine learning, was used to derive landscape areas containing the characteristics of various landscape elements. The study has elucidated the perception of new landscape resources and spaces that the existing analysis could not reveal. Mapping the landscape areas can contribute to the monitoring system of the protected area. ∙ Taeanhaean National Park comprises 12 Landscape types by analyzing users' perceptions using crowdsourced photo data. ∙ Four landscape areas were identified using a self-organizing map. ∙ Social media data and machine learning can be useful for monitoring users' perceptions of national parks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Crowdsourced photo data; Landscape areas; Landscape perception; Protected area; Self-organizing map,,,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2021R1A2C109486012); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF",This work has supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the the Ministry of Science and ICT (No. 2021R1A2C109486012 ).,"Ahn, Haesung, Does urban greenway design affect air pollution exposure?

Nitrogen dioxide (NO<inf>2</inf>) in the urban atmosphere, mainly emitted by anthropogenic sources such as industry and vehicles, is a key precursor of fine particles and ozone pollution. Both NO<inf>2</inf> and its secondary pollutants pose health risks for humans. Here we assess the interactions between urban forms and airborne NO<inf>2</inf> pollution in different cities with various stages of urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China, by using the machine learning and geographical regression model. The results reveal a strong correlation between urban fragmentation and tropospheric NO<inf>2</inf> vertical column density (TVCD) in YRD cities in 2020, particularly those with lower or higher levels of urbanization. The correlation coefficients (R2) between NO<inf>2</inf> TVCD and the largest patch index (a metric of urban fragmentation) in different cities are greater than 0.8. For cities at other urbanization stages, population and road density are strongly correlated with NO<inf>2</inf> TVCD, with an R2 larger than 0.61. This study highlights the interdependence among urbanization, urban forms, and air pollution, emphasizing the importance of customized urban landscape management strategies for mitigating urban air pollution. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollution; Nitrogen dioxide; Urban form; Urbanization,Air quality; Electric utilities; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; River pollution; Troposphere; Urban growth; Demand-side; Management policy; NO 2; Planning policies; Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide; Tropospheric NO; Urban form; Urbanization; Vertical column densities; Yangtze river delta; Regression analysis; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; health risk; troposphere; urban development; urban planning; urbanization; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; China; city planning; controlled study; health hazard; machine learning; policy; pollutant; pollution; urban area; Yangtze Delta,,"nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42375120, 62305322); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA23020301); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 42375120 , 62305322 ), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA23020301 ).","Ahn, Haesung, Urban form and air pollution: Clustering patterns of urban form factors related to particulate matter in Seoul, Korea, Sustainable Cities and Society, 81, (2022); Beirle, Steffen, The STRatospheric Estimation Algorithm from Mainz (STREAM): Estimating stratospheric NO2 from nadir-viewing satellites by weighted convolution, Atmospheric Measurement Techniques, 9, 7, pp. 2753-2779, (2016); Belgiu, Mariana, Random forest in remote sensing: A review of applications and future directions, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 114, pp. 24-31, (2016); Bereitschaft, Bradley, Urban form, air pollution, and CO2 emissions in large U.S. metropolitan areas, Professional Geographer, 65, 4, pp. 612-635, (2013); Boersma, Klaas Folkert, Validation of OMI tropospheric NO2 observations during INTEX-B and application to constrain NOx emissions over the eastern United States and Mexico, Atmospheric Environment, 42, 19, pp. 4480-4497, (2008); Brunsdont, Chris, Geographically weighted regression - Modelling spatial non-stationarity, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series D: The Statistician, 47, 3, pp. 431-443, (1998); Cárdenas Rodríguez, Miguel, Air pollution and urban structure linkages: Evidence from European cities, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 53, pp. 1-9, (2016); Chan, Kalok, TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument observations of total column water vapour: Algorithm and validation, Science of the Total Environment, 821, (2022); Chen, Jun, Collaborative validation of GlobeLand30: Methodology and practices, Geo-Spatial Information Science, 24, 1, pp. 134-144, (2021); Clark, James S., More than the sum of the parts: Forest climate response from joint species distribution models, Ecological Applications, 24, 5, pp. 990-999, (2014)","C.

The model is formulated as a Random Forest classifier that predicts the mode-duration probabilities of a given trip. A novel series of predictor features are proposed which measure the urban form, demographics, and service densities on different scales of the transportation network. Through a sensitivity analysis and a proof-of-concept case study, we find that a dense, mixed-use environment with good coverage of a multi-modal mobility network can significantly promote active transportation and public transit use. However, we also find that ultra-dense, centralized developments can lead to increased travel time and increased vehicle use in the urban periphery. Our modeling and analysis method provides a simplified and effective way to assess urban design and planning scenarios from different mobility perspectives and facilitates data-driven, mobility-aware urban design and planning that can help identify better solutions more quickly. © The Author(s) 2023.",machine learning; planning; travel behavior; urban design; urban mobility,machine learning; mobility; public transport; sensitivity analysis; transportation infrastructure; travel behavior; travel time; urban design; urban planning,,,,,"(20.701, 69A3551747119); California Department of Transportation, CT; Council of Fashion Designers of America, CFDA","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by The Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health (CTECH) and Federal Government CFDA #: 20.701 (69A3551747119).; Funding text 2: We thank the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) for providing geocoded NHTS travel survey data.

Among the various basic units carrying urban functions, residential community plays a vital part for supporting human life. Therefore, the layout planning of residential community has always been of concern, and has attracted particular attention since the advent of deep learning that facilitates the automated layout generation and spatial pattern recognition. However, the research circles generally suffer from the insufficiency of residential community layout benchmark or high-quality datasets, which hampers the future exploration of data-driven methods for residential community layout planning. The lack of datasets is largely due to the difficulties of large-scale real-world residential data acquisition and long-term expert screening. In order to address the issues and advance a benchmark dataset for various intelligent spatial design and analysis applications in the development of smart city, we introduce Residential Community Layout Planning (ReCo) Dataset, which is the first and largest open-source vector dataset related to real-world community to date. ReCo Dataset is presented in multiple data formats with 37,646 residential community layout plans, covering 598,728 residential buildings with height information. ReCo can be conveniently adapted for residential community layout related urban design tasks, e.g., generative layout design, morphological pattern recognition and spatial evaluation. To validate the utility of ReCo in automated residential community layout planning, two Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generative models are further applied to the dataset. We expect ReCo Dataset to inspire more creative and practical work in intelligent design and beyond.

This contribution introduces a new urban dataset, called YTU3D, which covers an area of approximately 2km2 and encompasses 45 distinct classes. Notably, YTU3D exceeds the class diversity of existing datasets, thereby enhancing its suitability for detailed urban analysis tasks. The paper presents also the application of three popular deep learning methods in the context of 3D semantic segmentation, along with a multi-level multi-resolution (MLMR) integration. Significantly, our work marks the first application of deep learning with MLMR in the literature and shows that a MLMR approach can improve the classification accuracy.

In this study, we aimed to provide a quantitative design method for urban space design that could take into account the preferences of different populations. Through empirical research, we collected real urban space and population data, which we then quantified using advanced intelligent recognition tools based on deep learning techniques. Our ensuing analysis illuminated the intricate interplay between constituent elements of urban spaces and the structural and emotional changes of residents. By taking into account the specific driving relationships between each element and residents, we proposed a new evaluation methodology for constructing an intelligent design evaluation model for urban spaces. This intelligent design evaluation model was subsequently used to evaluate the urban space both pre- and post-design. The standard deviation of the difference results demonstrated that the design option (SD value = 0.103) and the desired option for Space 1 were lower than the current option (SD value = 0.129) and the expected scheme. Our findings provide quantitative configuration strategies and program evaluation for urban space design, thus helping designers to design urban spaces that are more popular with residents. © 2023 by the authors.",emotion perception; intelligent evaluation; resident effect; space elements; urban space,design method; perception; urban design; urban population,,,,,,,"Chin J Comput, (2005); Life Between Buildings Using Public Space, (1987); Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Futures; Hou, Jingxuan, Quantifying the usage of small public spaces using deep convolutional neural network, PLOS ONE, 15, 10 October, (2020); Frank, Lawrence Douglas, The built environment and human activity patterns: Exploring the impacts of urban form on public health, Journal of Planning Literature, 16, 2, pp. 202-218, (2001); Hong, Jooyoung, Influence of urban contexts on soundscape perceptions: A structural equation modeling approach, Landscape and Urban Planning, 141, pp. 78-87, (2015); Ulrich, Roger S., Visual Landscapes and Psychological Weil-Being, Landscape Research, 4, 1, pp. 17-23, (1979); Ji, Haohao, A new data-enabled intelligence framework for evaluating urban space perception, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 10, 6, (2021); Paköz, Muhammed Ziya, Rethinking urban density, vitality and healthy environment in the post-pandemic city: The case of Istanbul, Cities, 124, (2022); Niu, Tong, Small public space vitality analysis and evaluation based on human trajectory modeling using video data, Building and Environment, 225, (2022)","S.

Unfortunately, the direct extraction of specific features from single satellite scenes can be difficult. However, the appropriate use of advanced processing methods based on deep learning algorithms allows us to obtain valuable information from these images. The height of buildings, for example, may be determined based on the extraction of shadows from an image and taking into account other metadata, e.g., the sun elevation angle and satellite azimuth angle. Classic methods of processing satellite imagery based on thresholding or simple segmentation are not sufficient because, in most cases, satellite scenes are not spectrally heterogenous. Therefore, the use of classical shadow detection methods is difficult. The authors of this article explore the possibility of using high-resolution optical satellite data to develop a universal algorithm for a fully automated estimation of object heights within the land cover by calculating the length of the shadow of each founded object. Finally, a set of algorithms allowing for a fully automatic detection of objects and shadows from satellite and aerial imagery and an iterative analysis of the relationships between them to calculate the heights of typical objects (such as buildings) and atypical objects (such as wind turbines) is proposed. The city of Warsaw (Poland) was used as the test area. LiDAR data were adopted as the reference measurement. As a result of final analyses based on measurements from several hundred thousand objects, the global accuracy obtained was ±4.66 m. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; earth observation; height estimation; remote sensing; satellite imagery; segmentation,Aerial photography; Antennas; Deep learning; Extraction; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Object detection; Optical radar; Optical remote sensing; Direct extraction; Earth observations; Height estimation; High resolution satellite images; Learning methods; Processing method; Remote-sensing; Segmentation; Urban landscape; Satellite imagery; algorithm; article; deep learning; extraction; human; human experiment; land use; metadata; Poland; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sun,,,,,"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna, WAT; Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geodesy, Military University of Technology, (815/2023)","This research was funded by Creotech Instruments S.A.

By conceiving an individual-level case-crossover study in central China, this analysis primarily aimed to quantify PM-mortality associations and examined the modification effect of greenness on the relationship. Methods: We investigated a total of 177,058 nonaccidental death cases from 12 counties in central China, 2008–2012. Daily residential exposures to PM<inf>2.5</inf> (aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm), PM<inf>c</inf> (aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 and 10 µm), and PM<inf>10</inf> (aerodynamic diameter <10 µm) were assessed at a 1 × 1-km resolution through satellite-derived machine-learning models. Residential surrounding greenness was assessed using satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at multiple buffer sizes (250, 500, and 1000 m). To quantify the acute mortality risks associated with short-term exposure to PM<inf>2.5</inf>, PM<inf>c</inf>, and PM<inf>10</inf>, a time-stratified case-crossover design was utilized in conjunction with a conditional logistic regression model in our main analyses. To investigate the effect modification of greenness on PM-mortality associations, we grouped death cases into low, medium, and high greenness levels using cutoffs of 25th and 75th percentiles of NDVI or EVI exposure, and examined potential effect heterogeneity in PM-related mortality risks among these groups. Results: Mean concentrations (standard deviation) on the day of death were 73.8 (33.4) μg/m3 for PM<inf>2.5</inf>, 43.9 (17.3) μg/m3 for PM<inf>c</inf>, and 117.5 (44.9) μg/m3 for PM<inf>10</inf>. Size-fractional PM exposures were consistently exhibited significant associations with elevated risks of nonaccidental and circulatory mortality. For every increase of 10-μg/m3 in PM exposure, percent excess risks of nonaccidental and circulatory mortality were 0.271 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.010, 0.533) and 0.487 (95% CI: 0.125, 0.851) for PM<inf>2.5</inf> at lag-01 day, 0.731 (95% CI: 0.108, 1.359) and 1.140 (95% CI: 0.267, 2.019) for PM<inf>c</inf> at lag-02 day, and 0.271 (95% CI: 0.010, 0.533) and 0.386 (95% CI: 0.111, 0.662) for PM<inf>10</inf> at lag-01 day, respectively. Compared to participants in the low-level greenness areas, those being exposed to higher greenness were found to be at lower PM-associated risks of nonaccidental and circulatory mortality. Consistent evidence for alleviated risks in medium or high greenness group was observed in subpopulations of female and younger groups (age <75). Conclusions: Short-term exposure to particulate air pollution was associated with elevated risks of nonaccidental and circulatory death, and individuals residing in higher neighborhood greenness possessed lower risk of PM-related mortality. These findings emphasized the potential public health advantages through incorporating green spaces into urban design and planning. © 2023 The Authors",Case-crossover design; Effect modification; Greenness; Mortality; Particulate matter; Short-term exposure,atmospheric pollution; greenspace; mortality; NDVI; particulate matter; pollution exposure; regression analysis; resident population; aged; air pollutant; Article; atmospheric particulate matter; cause of death; China; confidence interval; controlled study; dispersity; female; human; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; male; mortality risk; nonhuman; odds ratio; residential area; short term exposure; vegetation; air pollution; crossover procedure; dust; Air Pollution; Cross-Over Studies; Dust; Female; Humans; Particulate Matter,,Dust; Particulate Matter,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (2021CFB032); Wuhan University of Science and Technology, WUST, (2023C0102)","This study was supported by ""The 14th Five Year Plan"" Hubei Provincial Advantaged Characteristic Disciplines (Groups) Project of Wuhan University of Science and Technology (Grant No. 2023C0102 ) and the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2021CFB032 ).

It is difficult to quantify QoL as the word has varied meanings in different academic areas and may have different connotations in different circumstances. The five sectors most commonly associated with QoL, however, are Health, Education, Environmental Quality, Personal Security, Civic Engagement, and Work-Life Balance. An emerging issue that falls under environmental quality is visual pollution (VP) which, as detailed in this study, refers to disruptive presences that limit visual ability in public roads with an emphasis on excavation barriers, potholes, and dilapidated sidewalks. Quantifying VP has always been difficult due to its subjective nature and lack of a consistent set of rules for systematic assessment of visual pollution. This emphasizes the need for research and module development that will allow government agencies to automatically predict and detect VP. Our dataset was collected from different regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) via the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing (MOMRAH) as a part of a VP campaign to improve Saudi Arabia's urban landscape. It consists of 34,460 RGB images separated into three distinct classes: excavation barriers, potholes, and dilapidated sidewalks. To annotate all images for detection (i.e., bounding box) and classification (i.e., classification label) tasks, the deep active learning strategy (DAL) is used where an initial 1,200 VP images (i.e., 400 images per class) are manually annotated by four experts. Images with more than one object increase the number of training object ROIs which are recorded to be 8,417 for excavation barriers, 25,975 for potholes, and 7,412 for dilapidated sidewalks. The MOMRAH dataset is publicly published to enrich the research domain with the new VP image dataset. © 2023 The Author(s)",Active learning; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Deep learning; Image classification; Machine learning; Pollution,Classification (of information); Computer vision; Deep learning; Excavation; Learning systems; Pavements; Active Learning; Environmental quality; Images classification; Machine-learning; Public roads; Quality of life; Rural affairs; Rural housing; Visual pollution; Image classification,,,,,"(4300454067, 4400003688); Deanship of Scientific Research, King Faisal University, DSR; King Faisal University, KFU, (AN000673)","Funding text 1: We would like to acknowledge the project sponsors of Annual Funding track by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia .

This urban growth has a detrimental impact on the health and comfort of residents. The comfort level experienced in any given region depends on various parameters, including atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, land use and land cover (LULC). In this study, we aim to examine the spatial variation of outdoor thermal comfort in the city of Hyderabad. To achieve this, we utilize medium-resolution Landsat 8 imageries along with in situ meteorological data. The classification of LULC is carried out using the maximum likelihood method. A machine learning tool known as Support Vector Machine (SVM) is implemented, with seven environmental indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), new built-up index (NBI), LST, brightness, greenness, and wetness to predict outdoor thermal comfort (THI). The study reveals significant variations in THI across different land covers. Barren lands exhibit the highest mean THI values (27.3), followed by built-up areas (26.9), vegetation (24.1), and water bodies (20.7). These findings indicate that barren and built-up areas are associated with higher levels of discomfort, while vegetated regions and water bodies provide more neutral to moderate comfort conditions. These results also highlight distinct spatial variations in THI across different regions of the city, demonstrating the influence of the urban landscape on outdoor thermal comfort. This research is vital for identifying specific areas within cities that require targeted mitigation strategies to enhance outdoor comfort. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Landsat 8; outdoor thermal comfort; SVM; urban landscape,Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Land use; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Meteorology; Support vector machines; Urban growth; Vegetation; Built-up areas; Land use and land cover; LANDSAT; Landsat 8; Learning tool; Machine-learning; Outdoor thermal comfort; Spatial variations; Support vectors machine; Urban landscape; Landsat; air temperature; machine learning; metropolitan area; spatial variation; support vector machine; urban growth; Hyderabad [Telangana]; India; Telangana,,,,,"U.S. Geological Survey, USGS; Ministry of Education, India, MoE; Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, IIT KGP","Funding text 1: The first author of the manuscript, Hari Prasad, gratefully acknowledges the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur for conduct of the research work as a part of PhD work and providing the MHRD, Government of India, fellowship.

Through research in the fields of urban planning, urban design, and cognitive psychology, this paper defines three ecological evaluation indexes correspondingly. They measure the vegetation coverage of land (planning green), the visibility of vegetation from the pedestrian’s viewpoint (visual green), and the psychological perception of greenery by human (perceived green). This study uses computerized parametric analysis, computerized deep learning, data visualization, and statistical methods to achieve an accurate description of the three evaluation indicators. This study assumes that the three green values may behave consistently or inconsistently at each point. Therefore, this study, on the one hand, tries to analyze the potential factors affecting each green indicator. On the other hand, by analysing the consistency or discrepancy of the three green values, this research revealed the potential link between urban spatial type and integrated ecological properties. Four areas of Brisbane dominated by different functions were selected for this study (Red Hill and Bardon for residential areas, Brisbane City for downtown CBD, and Woolloongabba for industrial areas). The results of the study demonstrate the credibility and applicability of the three green indicators in different areas, examine the various factors affecting ecology, and provide new design strategies and ideas for urban designers. © The Author(s) 2023.",green perception; street view image; subjective measurement; urban ecology; Urban green space,Data visualization; Deep learning; Urban planning; Vegetation; Cognitive psychology; Comprehensive evaluation system; Ecological evaluation; Green indicator; Green perception; Street view image; Subjective measurements; Urban design; Urban ecology; Urban green spaces; Ecology,,,,,,,"Ecological Urbanism, (2010); Urban Ecology, (1998); Urban Ecology, (2010); Kabisch, Nadja, Human-environment interactions in urban green spaces - A systematic review of contemporary issues and prospects for future research, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 50, pp. 25-34, (2015); Ma, Xiangyuan, Measuring human perceptions of streetscapes to better inform urban renewal: A perspective of scene semantic parsing, Cities, 110, (2021); Ewing, Reid H., Measuring the unmeasurable: Urban design qualities related to walkability, Journal of Urban Design, 14, 1, pp. 65-84, (2009); Xiao, Chao, Assessing the spatial distribution pattern of street greenery and its relationship with socioeconomic status and the built environment in Shanghai, China, Land, 10, 8, (2021); Li, Xiaojiang, Does the visibility of greenery increase perceived safety in urban areas?

With the ubiquitous use of social media and the prosperous developments in machine and deep learning, it has become feasible to collect and process massive amounts of information produced by online communities about their perceptions of heritage as social constructs. Moreover, such information is usually inter-connected and embedded within specific socioeconomic and spatiotemporal contexts. This paper presents a methodological workflow for using semi-supervised learning with graph neural networks (GNN) to classify, summarize, and map cultural significance categories based on user-generated content on social media. Several GNN models were trained as an ensemble to incorporate the multi-modal (visual and textual) features and the contextual (temporal, spatial, and social) connections of social media data in an attributed multi-graph structure. The classification results with different models were aligned and evaluated with the prediction confidence and agreement. Furthermore, message diffusion methods on graphs were proposed to aggregate the post labels onto their adjacent spatial nodes, which helps to map the cultural significance categories in their geographical contexts. The workflow is tested on data gathered from Venice as a case study, demonstrating the generation of social perception maps for this UNESCO World Heritage property. This research framework could also be applied in other cities worldwide, contributing to more socially inclusive heritage management processes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology holds the potential of diffusing any human-generated location-based information onto spatial networks and temporal timelines, which could be beneficial for measuring the safety, vitality, and/or popularity of urban spaces. © 2023 The Author(s)",Graph Neural Networks; Heritage values and attributes; Label diffusion; Multi-modal machine learning; Social media data; Spectral centrality,Graph neural networks; Learning systems; Photomapping; Social networking (online); Urban planning; Heritage value and attribute; Heritage values; Label diffusion; Machine-learning; Multi-modal; Multi-modal machine learning; Social media datum; Social perception; Spectral centrality; Deep learning; artificial neural network; cultural heritage; culture; detection method; machine learning; mapping method; perception; social media; spectral analysis; supervised classification; UNESCO; Italy; Veneto; Venezia [Veneto]; Venice,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (813883); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA; Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: The presented study is within the framework of the Heriland-Consortium.

Recent years have witnessed notable advancements in land use/cover classification, driven by improvements in classification methods and the utilization of data from multiple sources. Deep learning networks, especially, have gained prominence in various image analysis tasks, including land use/cover classification. However, when it comes to urban areas, the classification of urban land use/cover encounters additional obstacles, including the complexity of classes, limited training data, and the presence of numerous urban categories. To overcome the limitations arising from similar classes and insufficient training data, we propose a novel approach that integrates hyperspectral and LiDAR data through a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for semantic segmentation. Our methodology leverages the UNet + + generator and PatchGAN discriminator to achieve accurate segmentation. The CGAN-generated segmented images are then processed by a fully connected neural network (FCN) to classify 20 land use/cover classes. By validating our approach on the 2018 GRSS Data Fusion dataset, our study demonstrates its exceptional operational performance. The CGAN architecture outperforms previous algorithms in terms of class diversity and training data volume. By generating synthetic data that closely resembles the ground truth, the CGAN enhances the classification performance. Clear visual distinctions are observed among various urban features, such as vegetation, trees, buildings, roads, and cars. Classes associated with healthy grass, stressed grass, bare earth, and stadium seats achieve high accuracy. However, road and railway classes exhibit poorer performance due to their similarity with sidewalk, highway, major thoroughfare, and crosswalk classes. Overall, our study showcases a significant improvement in classification accuracy, achieving an approximate accuracy of 96.98% compared to the winning articles presented in the 2018 competition, which achieved accuracies of 64.95% and 76.54%, respectively. This improvement in accuracy can be attributed to the effective extraction and combination of high and low-level urban land cover/land use features within our proposed architecture. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",CGAN; Fusion; Land use classification; Multi-source data; Patchgan; UNet + +,artificial neural network; image analysis; land classification; land use planning; lidar; semantic standardization; urban area,,,,,,"The authors are grateful to the committee of the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest for providing the hyperspectral and LiDAR data, and their efforts in promoting the development of multisource remote-sensing data fusion.","Akar, Ozlem, Land use/land cover mapping from airborne hyperspectral images with machine learning algorithms and contextual information, Geocarto International, 37, 14, pp. 3963-3990, (2022); Bousias Alexakis, Evangelos, Evaluation of unet and unet++ architectures in high resolution image change detection applications, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 43, B3, pp. 1507-1514, (2020); Chen, Xiaoling, Remote sensing image-based analysis of the relationship between urban heat island and land use/cover changes, Remote Sensing of Environment, 104, 2, pp. 133-146, (2006); Chen, Yushi, Deep fusion of hyperspectral and LiDAR data for thematic classification, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2016-November, pp. 3591-3594, (2016); Chen, Gang, Multi-scale patch-GAN with edge detection for image inpainting, Applied Intelligence, 53, 4, pp. 3917-3932, (2023); Debes, Christian, Hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion: Outcome of the 2013 GRSS data fusion contest, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 7, 6, pp. 2405-2418, (2014); Feng, Quanlong, Multisource hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion for urban land-use mapping based on a modified two-branch convolutional neural network, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 8, 1, (2019); 22nd Earsel Symposium Geoinformation for European Wide Integration, (2025); Herold, M., Spectrometry for urban area remote sensing - Development and analysis of a spectral library from 350 to 2400 nm, Remote Sensing of Environment, 91, 3-4, pp. 304-319, (2004); Huang, Xin, Information fusion of aerial images and LIDAR data in urban areas: Vector-stacking, re-classification and post-processing approaches, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 32, 1, pp. 69-84, (2011)","M.

This study adopted ambulatory sensing to monitor high spatiotemporal physiological stress from skin conductance level (SCL) and analyzed the association between the visual environment and the SCL in high-density environments. The multi-level visual environment was quantified from isovist and street view images. The most influential lags for each visual exposure factor were identified. Furthermore, multiple linear regression (MLR) and geographical random forest (GRF) were established to examine the effects of the lagged visual exposure factors on SCL. Particularly, the GRF can explore spatial nonstationary and complex relationships. The MLR (R2 = 0.466) suggests that exposure to trees, sky, and sign symbols can relieve stress. The GRF with 5 visual exposure factors can explain 87.4% of the spatial variance of SCL. This study confirms the effectiveness of monitoring pedestrians’ stress in high-density cities and the phased and non-instantaneous impacts of the visual environment. The results have practical implications in urban design at both district and site levels for a sustainable and psychologically friendly urban environment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Ambulatory technology; Geographical random forest; Isovist; Moving window; Skin conductance level; Street view,Forestry; Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Physiology; Sustainable development; Ambulatory technology; Geographical random forest; Isovists; Moving window; Physiological stress; Random forests; Skin conductance; Skin conductance level; Street view; Visual environments; Urban growth; geographical thought; pedestrian; physiological response; planning process; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban design; vision,,,,,"Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2042023kf0004)",The study is supported by a PGS studentship from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

This has significant implications for ventilation, overheating, wind chill, and safety concerns such as down drafts from skyscrapers. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are the best practice for analyzing urban airflow patterns in design, they are computationally expensive and require a high level of expertise, making them underutilized in the early design process. This paper presents a surrogate model for CFD using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can process arbitrary building geometries. The model is trained using an automated end-to-end pipeline based on Eddy3D and implemented within the Rhino and Grasshopper environment as an Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)-based CFD-GAN predictor. This workflow provides instantaneous simulation feedback within the design software, reduces the risk of user error, and allows for appropriate spatial resolution in early design. The CFD-GAN demonstrates promising accuracy, with a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) ranging from 75%–97% on a limited training dataset of 564 unique urban geometries. Although the model currently has limitations regarding accuracy in complex urban wake regions, we show that these are likely not of concern for outdoor thermal comfort analyses. While it cannot replace CFD in later design stages, the CFD-GAN facilitates the incorporation of urban airflow analysis in early design with minimal effort and instantaneous performance feedback. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Generative Adversarial Network (GAN); Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX); Pedestrian comfort; Surrogate modeling; Urban design,Air; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer software; Design; Office buildings; Tall buildings; Airflow patterns; Computational fluid dynamic; Early designs; Generative adversarial network; Network-based; Neural-networks; Open neural network exchange; Pedestrian comfort; Surrogate modeling; Urban design; Generative adversarial networks; airflow; building; computational fluid dynamics; machine learning; modeling; pedestrian; prediction; urban design,,,,,,We would like to thank Panagiotis Michalatos for his helpful remarks regarding Pix2Pix and his help with OpenCV image manipulation.,"Blocken, Bert J.E., Computational Fluid Dynamics for urban physics: Importance, scales, possibilities, limitations and ten tips and tricks towards accurate and reliable simulations, Building and Environment, 91, pp. 219-245, (2015); Piracha, Awais, Urban Air Pollution, Urban Heat Island and Human Health: A Review of the Literature, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 15, (2022); Vanky, Anthony P., Effect of weather on pedestrian trip count and duration: City-scale evaluations using mobile phone application data, Preventive Medicine Reports, 8, pp. 30-37, (2017); Reinhart, Christoph F., Biometeorological indices explain outside dwelling patterns based on Wi-Fi data in support of sustainable urban planning, Building and Environment, 126, pp. 422-430, (2017); Nazarian, Negin, Outdoor thermal comfort autonomy: Performance metrics for climate-conscious urban design, Building and Environment, 155, pp. 145-160, (2019); Mattoni, Benedetta, Comparison among different green buildings assessment tools: Application to a case study, Building Simulation Applications, 2017-February, pp. 97-104, (2017); Kastner, Patrick, A cylindrical meshing methodology for annual urban computational fluid dynamics simulations, Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 13, 1, pp. 59-68, (2020); Kastner, Patrick, Eddy3D: A toolkit for decoupled outdoor thermal comfort simulations in urban areas, Building and Environment, 212, (2022); Bre, Facundo, Prediction of wind pressure coefficients on building surfaces using artificial neural networks, Energy and Buildings, 158, pp. 1429-1441, (2018); Jin, Xiaowei, Prediction model of velocity field around circular cylinder over various Reynolds numbers by fusion convolutional neural networks based on pressure on the cylinder, Physics of Fluids, 30, 4, (2018)","P.

Tree planting, a crucial aspect of green infrastructure, has been analyzed for optimized positioning using data metrics, priority scoring, and GIS. However, due to the dynamic nature of environmental information, the accuracy of current approaches is compromised. This study aims to present a novel approach integrating deep learning and cellular automata to prioritize urban tree planting locations to anticipate the optimal urban tree network. Initially, GIS data were collated and visualized to identify a suitable study site within London. CycleGAN models were trained using cellular automata outputs and forest mycorrhizal network samples. The comparison validated cellular automata’s applicability, enabled observing spatial feature information in the outputs and guiding the parameter design of our 3D cellular automata system for predicting tree planting locations. The locations were optimized by simulating the network connectivity of urban trees after planting, following the spatial-behavioral pattern of the forest mycorrhizal network. The results highlight the role of robust tree networks in fostering ecological stability and cushioning climate change impacts in urban contexts. The proposed approach addresses existing methodological and practical limitations, providing innovative strategies for optimal tree planting and prioritization of urban green infrastructure, thereby informing sustainable urban planning and design. Our findings illustrate the symbiotic relationship between urban trees and future cities and offer insights into street tree density planning, optimizing the spatial distribution of trees within urban landscapes for sustainable urban development. © 2023 by the authors.",carbon emissions; ecological system; green infrastructure; urban forestry; urban planting,accuracy assessment; cellular automaton; climate change; urban area; urban development; urban forestry; urban planning; England; London [England]; United Kingdom,,,,,,,"Di Vita, Giuseppe Antonio, A review of the role of vegetal ecosystems in CO2 capture, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 10, (2017); Wang, Nuo, Accounting for China’s Net Carbon Emissions and Research on the Realization Path of Carbon Neutralization Based on Ecosystem Carbon Sinks, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 22, (2022); Sima, Sergiu, Phase Behavior of Carbon Dioxide + Isobutanol and Carbon Dioxide + tert-Butanol Binary Systems, Energies, 15, 7, (2022); Reichle, David E., The Global Carbon Cycle and Climate Change: Scaling Ecological Energetics from Organism to the Biosphere, pp. 1-677, (2023); Walther, Gian Reto, Ecological responses to recent climate change, Nature, 416, 6879, pp. 389-395, (2002); Climate Change 2001 Synthesis Report, (2001); Science, (2021); Badiou, Pascal H.

Station-level boarding and alighting ridership at different times of the day was obtained from smart card records and used as the dependent variable. Nineteen independent variables, including land use, were calculated based on the directional and size-various catchment area defined by shared bike's origin-destination data. This framework, which accounts for spatial heterogeneity demonstrated strong goodness-of-fit and prediction capability, which has been ignored in previous studies. Furthermore, the proposed framework contributed to modeling based on geographical weighted regression and global machine learning models. Local relative importance mapping of built environment variables revealed varying impacts across Shanghai, diverging from the common practice of averaging into a single value in global machine learning models. Additionally, the nonlinear relationship between influencing variables, such as leisure and shopping, demonstrated a positive trend with boarding and alighting ridership in different periods, and spatio-temporal heterogeneity with the effective range and threshold effect. Rather than focusing on increasing development density to boost metro ridership, this study assesses the saturation of station-level built environment to enable more accurate decision-making based on location, station design, station-area planning, and investment priorities in urban areas. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",built environment; metro ridership; nonlinear effects; spatial heterogeneity; spatial validation,Catchments; Decision trees; Investments; Land use; Leisure; Machine learning; Urban planning; Built environment; Calibration and validations; Gradient boosting; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Metro ridership; Nonlinear effect; Spatial calibration; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial validation; Smart cards; decision making; investment; machine learning; metro system; nonlinearity; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; travel behavior; urban design; urban transport; China; Shanghai,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (20ZR1462200); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52078343); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (22120210540); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52078343 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai ( 20ZR1462200 ) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 22120210540 ).

Taking the city of Guangzhou as a case study, deep learning was combined with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform effective image recognition, vector cutting, and automatic area statistics based on multilevel road networks. Road network division, block area processing, characteristic parameter calculation, and LCZ classification were integrated to automatically generate block-scale-oriented LCZ maps, which was achieved via threshold contrast using the recommended parameter intervals of the calculated characteristic parameters. Basic land surface temperature (LST) data for summer to winter in Guangzhou were then applied, and correlation analysis was conducted between the block-scale LST vector and LCZ characteristic parameters.

Geographically weighted regression (GWR), machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely XGBoost and LightGBM, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods are utilized. The study observes that urban areas are often cooler due to the presence of urban heat sinks (UHSs), more noticeably in coastal cities. However, LST is seen to increase across all cities due to urbanization and the degradation of vegetation cover. The increase in LST is more pronounced in inland cities surrounded by barren landscapes. Interestingly, XGBoost frequently outperforms LightGBM in the analyses. ML models and SHAP demonstrate efficacy in deciphering urban heat dynamics despite data quality and model tuning challenges. The study’s results highlight the crucial role of ongoing urbanization, topography, and the existence of water bodies and vegetation in driving LST dynamics. These findings underscore the importance of sustainable urban planning and vegetation cover in mitigating urban heat, thus having significant policy implications. Despite its contributions, this study acknowledges certain limitations, primarily the use of data from only four discrete years, thereby overlooking inter-annual, seasonal, and diurnal variations in LST dynamics. © 2023 by the authors.",Land Surface Temperature (LST); machine learning; Moroccan urban landscapes,Atmospheric temperature; Dynamics; Land surface temperature; Public policy; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Topography; Urban planning; Vegetation; Comparative analyzes; Machine-learning; Moroccan urban landscape; Shapley; Temperature dynamics; Thermal variation; Urban landscape; Vegetation cover; Machine learning; city; environmental monitoring; high temperature; procedures; temperature; urbanization; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; Temperature; Urbanization,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (22F22303, 22KF0054)",This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 22F22303 and 22KF0054.,"Li, Zhaoliang, Satellite-derived land surface temperature: Current status and perspectives, Remote Sensing of Environment, 131, pp. 14-37, (2013); Voogt, James A., Thermal remote sensing of urban climates, Remote Sensing of Environment, 86, 3, pp. 370-384, (2003); Derdouri, Ahmed, Understanding the links between lulc changes and suhi in cities: Insights from two-decadal studies (2001–2020), Remote Sensing, 13, 18, (2021); Athukorala, Darshana, Urban heat island formation in greater cairo: Spatio-temporal analysis of daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures along the urban-rural gradient, Remote Sensing, 13, 7, (2021); Wang, Ruci, Spatiotemporal analysis of land use/cover patterns and their relationship with land surface temperature in Nanjing, China, Remote Sensing, 12, 3, (2020); Deilami, Kaveh, Urban heat island effect: A systematic review of spatio-temporal factors, data, methods, and mitigation measures, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 67, pp. 30-42, (2018); World Cities Report 2020 the Value of Sustainable Urbanization, (2020); Journal of Geographic Information System, (2012); Lachir, Asia, Modeling the Urban Impact on Semiarid Surface Climate: A Case Study in Marrakech, Morocco, Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing, 42, 4, pp. 379-395, (2016); Bahi, Hicham, Effects of urbanization and seasonal cycle on the surface urban heat island patterns in the coastal growing cities: A case study of Casablanca, Morocco, Remote Sensing, 8, 10, (2016)","A.

However, planning for active mobility is a complex endeavour due to numerous local, place-based factors that influence active mobility decisions. Recent advancements in urban data research have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning methods in evaluating active mobility potential for urban environments. At present, the incorporation of semantic information from deep learning models and street view imagery into spatio-temporal contexts remains a challenge. In particular, knowledge extraction from deep learning models remains an open question for urban planning and decision-making. Towards this issue, we propose a functional deep learning and network science workflow that employs open data from OpenStreetMap and Mapillary to assess factors affecting active mobility decisions and route planning. We demonstrate the generalisability of our analytical workflow through two case studies focusing on urban greenery in Nerima city (Japan) and urban visual complexity in Pasir Ris town (Singapore). Our results reveal clear patterns of heterogeneity in urban streetscapes and identify unevenness in street infrastructure provision based on destination types. Using this information, we propose specific areas for design intervention to improve active mobility planning. Our workflow is applicable for a diverse range of use cases making it relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, not limited to, urban researchers, policy makers and urban planners. © The Author(s) 2022.",Computer vision; machine learning; urban analytics; volunteered geographic information; walking behaviour,computer vision; decision making; GIS; machine learning; mobility; network analysis; urban design; urban planning; walking; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Nerima; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Tokyo [Kanto]; Tokyo [Tokyo (PRF)],,,,,"National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-295-000-171-133); National University of Singapore, NUS","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore Grant (R-295-000-171-133).","Agryzkov, Taras, A variant of the current flow betweenness centrality and its application in urban networks, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 347, pp. 600-615, (2019); Alvarez Leon, Luis Felipe, The value of crowdsourced street-level imagery: examining the shifting property regimes of OpenStreetCam and Mapillary, GeoJournal, 84, 2, pp. 395-414, (2019); Anselin, Luc E., Open Source Software for Spatial Data Science, Geographical Analysis, 54, 3, pp. 429-438, (2022); Trees in Urban Design, (1980); Arribas-Bel, Daniel, Open data products-A framework for creating valuable analysis ready data, Journal of Geographical Systems, 23, 4, pp. 497-514, (2021); Banerjee, Tridib, Walking to School: The Experience of Children in Inner City Los Angeles and Implications for Policy, Journal of Planning Education and Research, 34, 2, pp. 123-140, (2014); Basu, Rounaq, How do street attributes affect willingness-to-walk?

The user-generated information already available on social media platforms in the form of images, comments, and ratings can be considered a rich source for collecting data concerning the tourists' image of destinations and their collective perception of urban cultural heritage. Considering the large amount of unstructured data, artificial intelligence (AI) can construct structured feature vectors therefrom and significantly aid the analysis and collation processes compared to the traditional manual approach for mapping public perception of cultural heritage. This paper presents an exploratory case study conducted in the area of Testaccio, Rome, showcasing the use of AI to map the perceived and narrated urban heritage images using social media data. An image-sharing platform, Flickr, is used to collect thousands of posts containing images and comments in the area, which are further analysed with pre-Trained image recognition, natural language processing, and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Results as the urban heritage images are visualised, showing the most significant elements from a public perspective. Such a methodology provides an alternative perspective of viewing the urban heritage attributes as a collection of depicted and posted content. It can contribute as a tool for the documentation of collective attention for inclusive heritage management and local development planning during the designing and policy-making processes. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

Although great efforts have been made by the scientific community to develop applications that utilize KH-9 HEXAGON images, little attention has been paid to de-noising and contrast enhancement of these images particularly over urban landscapes. This paper focuses on developing a de-noising and contrast enhancement pipeline for KH-9 HEXAGON MCS and PCS over urban regions. The proposed approach employs first a wavelet transform trained using a suite of ‘degree of over-smoothing’ metrics (DOSM) for image de-noising. These metrics are sensitive to structure, texture, edges and local homogeneity of image objects. Then the de-noised image is subjected to the multi-resolution Top-hat to optimize the contrast. This method incorporates a range of shapes and neighborhoods at multiple scales. The method was applied to a KH-9 HEXAGON MCS image (acquired in 1975) and PCS image (acquired in 1974) representing a complex urban landscape, to support comprehensive evaluation under a range of settings. Performance was assessed against three state-of-the-art benchmark approaches: residual learning (deep learning), blind deconvolution and spatial filtering. To evaluate the performance of the proposed pipeline against the benchmarks, we employed the saturation image edge difference standard-deviation, co-occurrence metrics and the semivariogram. Additionally, the potential applications of pre-processed results were demonstrated using change detection, identification reference points and stereo images. The proposed method not only improved the quality of the KH-9 image across the different urban landscape types, but also preserved the original spatial characteristics of the image in comparison with the benchmark methods. At a time when understanding the nature of our changing planet is paramount, the proposed pipeline should be of great benefit to investigators wishing to use KH program images to extend their historical or time-series analyses further back in time. © 2023 The Authors",Blind deconvolution; Keyhole program; KH-9 HEXAGON; MCS; PCS; Residual learning; Stereo; Top-hat; Wavelet,,,,,,,,"Journal of Signal and Information Processing, (2013); Andersen, G.

For this purpose, a soil dataset of 250 points sampled from a 0–20 cm depth on different land uses, including residential, industrial and undisturbed (forests and parks), was used. Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost), Cubist and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) ML techniques were employed to model and map the Hg concentrations. We used remote sensing data (RSD) and topographic attributes as explanatory variables. ML models were calibrated and validated using the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The Hg content varied from 0.005 to 0.58 mg/kg and was characterized by very high variability. According to the MAE and RMSE metrics, the RF method resulted in the most accurate spatial prediction for the Hg content (0.029 and 0.065 mg/kg, respectively), while the XGBoost approach showed the lowest prediction efficiency (0.032 and 0.073 mg/kg, respectively). The results showed that the slope map, spectral index MSI and Sentinel-2A band B11 were the key variables in explaining the variability of Hg content. We found that higher uncertainty values of soil Hg were found in croplands, urban residential and industrial areas, which supports the view that spatial modelling of HM in urban landscapes is challenging. The present study provides insights into the potential of digital soil mapping techniques in combination with RSD and terrain variables for identifying areas at risk of Hg contamination in urban areas, which can inform land-use planning and management strategies to protect human health and the environment. © 2023 by the authors.",digital soil mapping; heavy metals; machine leaning; mercury; random forest; urban soils,E-learning; Forestry; Health risks; Heavy metals; Housing; Land use; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mapping; Nearest neighbor search; Parks; Random forests; Remote sensing; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Soils; Statistical methods; Uncertainty analysis; Digital soil mappings; Machine leaning; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Mercuries (Hg); Mercury; Remote sensing data; Remote-sensing; Urban soils; Forecasting,,,,,"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (FMEN 2022-0012, FMEN 2022-0014, FMRS-2023-0006); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation № FMRS-2023-0006, FMEN 2022-0012, FMEN 2022-0014.","Balali-Mood, Mehdi, Toxic Mechanisms of Five Heavy Metals: Mercury, Lead, Chromium, Cadmium, and Arsenic, Frontiers in Pharmacology, 12, (2021); Polyakov, Vyacheslav Igorevich, Soil pollution status of urban soils in St. Petersburg city, North-west of Russia, Soil and Water Research, 16, 3, pp. 164-173, (2021); Yang, Qingchun, Bioavailability and health risk of toxic heavy metals (As, Hg, Pb and Cd) in urban soils: A Monte Carlo simulation approach, Environmental Research, 214, (2022); Bradl, Heike B., Chapter 1 Sources and origins of heavy metals, Interface Science and Technology, 6, C, pp. 1-27, (2005); Opekunova, Marina G., Transformation of metals migration and biogeochemical cycling under the influence of copper mining production (the Southern Urals), Catena, 189, (2020); Suleymanov, Ruslan R., Assessment of Chemical Properties, Heavy Metals, and Metalloid Contamination in Floodplain Soils under the Influence of Copper Mining: A Case Study of Sibay, Southern Urals, Ecologies, 3, 4, pp. 530-538, (2022); Malar, Srinivasan, Assessment of mercury heavy metal toxicity-induced physiochemical and molecular changes in Sesbania grandiflora L., International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, 12, 10, pp. 3273-3282, (2015); Perugini, Monia, Heavy metal (Hg, Cr, Cd, and Pb) contamination in urban areas and wildlife reserves: Honeybees as bioindicators, Biological Trace Element Research, 140, 2, pp. 170-176, (2011); Tangahu, Bieby Voijant, A review on heavy metals (As, Pb, and Hg) uptake by plants through phytoremediation, International Journal of Chemical Engineering, (2011); Zhao, Haodong, Comprehensive assessment of harmful heavy metals in contaminated soil in order to score pollution level, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022)","R.

However, high-resolution data on building height, especially at the national scale, are limited. Fortunately, high spatial-temporal resolution earth observations, harnessed using a cloud-based platform, offer an opportunity to fill this gap. We describe an approach to estimate 2020 building height for China at 10 m spatial resolution based on all-weather earth observations (radar, optical, and night light images) using the Random Forest (RF) model. Results show that our building height simulation has a strong correlation with real observations at the national scale (RMSE of 6.1 m, MAE = 5.2 m, R = 0.77). The Combinational Shadow Index (CSI) is the most important contributor (15.1%) to building height simulation. Analysis of the distribution of building morphology reveals significant differences in building volume and average building height at the city scale across China. Macau has the tallest buildings (22.3 m) among Chinese cities, while Shanghai has the largest building volume (298.4 108 m3). The strong correlation between modelled building volume and socio-economic parameters indicates the potential application of building height products. The building height map developed in this study with a resolution of 10 m is open access, provides insights into the 3D morphological characteristics of cities and serves as an important contribution to future urban studies in China. © 2023",Building height; Google earth engine; Machine learning; Multi-sensor; Urban morphology,Buildings; Earth (planet); Forestry; Morphology; Observatories; Building height; Earth observations; Google earth engine; Google earths; Height estimate; Machine-learning; Multi sensor; Multi-Sources; Strong correlation; Urban morphology; Machine learning; building; height; machine learning; observational method; sensor; software; urban design; China; Macau; Shanghai,,,,,"Horizon 2020; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFE0193100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (19DZ1203405); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42171093); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (821016); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106100112); China Scholarship Council, CSC","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (grant no. 2021YFE0193100 ), the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai (grant no. 19DZ1203405 ), European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant no. 821016 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 42171093 ) and China Scholarship Council (grant no. 202106100112 ).","Alahmadi, Mohammed Hussain, Estimating the spatial distribution of the population of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia using remotely sensed built land cover and height data, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 41, pp. 167-176, (2013); Borck, Rainald, Will skyscrapers save the planet?

Our objective is to quantify and map landscape value by developing a novel intelligent landscape value evaluation method based on online texts. We argue that online texts can be converted into quantities through deep learning technology, which allows the measurement of public preference, emotional tendency and intensity. We selected perception frequency, perception heat, perception preference and the value index as indicators to quantify landscape value, which is the product of perception heat and perception preference. We collected more than 14,000 online texts about the Orange Islands in Changsha city from 2010 to 2020, analysed the perception heat using Python to extract data, and analysed the perception preference using Baidu API sentiment analysis technology. The results show that the novel method has a wide range of data sources and represents the real public perception and value orientation, demonstrating that online texts with a wealth of mined information can be used to evaluate landscape value. The model calculating the landscape value overcomes the shortcomings of current methods that ignore public preference, emotional tendency and intensity. The results also show that the conservation mode of Orange Island is successful, and the conservation method suggested by the recommendation on the historic urban landscape is feasible. The study highlights the contribution of public preferences to landscape value and provides insight into the situations and variations of value types on Orange Island. The novel method is highly intelligent, time-saving, has low labour costs, and is applicable and can be applied to the evaluation of landscape value, especially in cases where value conflicts exist. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Cultural ecosystem services; Historic urban landscape; Machine learning; Orange island; Public perception; Social media,cultural heritage; ecosystem service; heritage conservation; Internet; landscape structure; machine learning; mapping method; perception; quantitative analysis; social behavior; social media; urban area; urban history; Changsha; China; Hunan,,,,,,,"Alessa, Lilian Na Ia, Social-ecological hotspots mapping: A spatial approach for identifying coupled social-ecological space, Landscape and Urban Planning, 85, 1, pp. 27-39, (2008); Alphan, Hakan, Geospatial analysis of lake scenery as an indicator for the environment: The City of Van (Turkey) and its surroundings, Environmental and Sustainability Indicators, 9, (2021); Values and Heritage Conservation, (2000); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2015); Bandarin, Francesco, The Historic Urban Landscape: Managing Heritage in an Urban Century, (2012); undefined, (2019); Barthel-Bouchier, Diane, Cultural heritage and the challenge of sustainability, pp. 1-235, (2016); Biedenweg, Kelly A., Is recreation a landscape value?: Exploring underlying values in landscape values mapping, Landscape and Urban Planning, 185, pp. 24-27, (2019); Brown, Greg Gordon, Mapping spatial attributes in survey research for natural resource management: Methods and applications, Society and Natural Resources, 18, 1, pp. 17-39, (2005); International Journal of Tourism Research, (2006)","Q.

However, the mapping process is difficult because of image resolution limitations and the lack of detailed planning data. To our knowledge for the first time, to promote the application of refined LCZ maps in urban climate research, we have proposed the downscaling mapping process by by integrating GIS workflow and remote sensing workflow. The results have shown that: (1) By adjusting the scale and input of the deep learning model, the LCZ basemap achieved the highest overall accuracy of 83.64% and the highest data matching degree of 0.71. (2) Visual interpretation showed that the overall accuracy of LCZ map at all scales is >70%, and the highest overall accuracy of 84.44% is achieved at 20 m scale. (3) Usefulness assessment showed that the LST levels of LCZs significantly differ at all scales (p < 0.01). The 160 m scale was the most suitable for analysis of the thermal characteristics of urban landscapes. This downscaling mapping method will help urban planners in developing urban climate models to determine the impact mechanisms of urban development and support progress in sustainable urban development efforts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Deep learning model optimization; Geographic information system; Local climate zone; Optimal mapping scale analysis; Refinement mapping,,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41671151, 41771178, 42030409); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Guizhou Province; Department of Education of Liaoning Province, (LJKZ0964); Department of Education of Liaoning Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (N2111003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This research study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no's 41771178 , 42030409 , and 41671151 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grantno.

However, two aspects of VCA still need improvement for more detailed modeling of urban landscape dynamics. One is the lack of simulation of urban renewal prevalent in megacities. The other is the lack of simulation of vertical urban landscape dynamics at the parcel level. Hence, this study should be the first to propose a comprehensive VCA framework for modeling horizontal and vertical multi-type urban landscape dynamics (HV-MVCA) at the parcel level. The HV-MVCA consists of two modules: a deep learning-based horizontal urban landscape dynamic simulation module and a random forest-based (RF) vertical metrics prediction module. Compared with traditional VCA, the HV-MVCA can obtain the highest simulation accuracy with an enhancement of 1.45%-4.56%. The RF-based fitting model can reasonably interpret the vertical metric as the coefficient of determination and the mean absolute percentage error was 0.88 and 28.93%. By localizing shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), the horizontal and vertical urban landscape dynamics in the future can be simulated under different scenarios. As the multi-scenario simulation results can provide abundant horizontal and vertical information at the parcel level, the proposed HV-MVCA can help achieve a more comprehensive assessment of many urban-related issues with these indicators, such as energy consumption, climate change, and pollution emissions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Deep learning; Horizontal and vertical dimensions; Multi-type urban landscape dynamics; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Vector-based cellular automata,cellular automaton; landscape; simulation; socioeconomic impact; urban renewal,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42130107); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",This study was supported by the Key National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42130107).,"undefined, (2008); Jokar Arsanjani, Jamal, Integration of logistic regression, Markov chain and cellular automata models to simulate urban expansion, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 21, 1, pp. 265-275, (2013); undefined, (2013); Barr, Jason M., Skyscraper Height, Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 45, 3, pp. 723-753, (2012); Barreira-González, Pablo, From raster to vector cellular automata models: A new approach to simulate urban growth with the help of graph theory, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 54, pp. 119-131, (2015); Cao, Min, A new discovery of transition rules for cellular automata by using cuckoo search algorithm, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 29, 5, pp. 806-824, (2015); Chen, Guangzhao, Global projections of future urban land expansion under shared socioeconomic pathways, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Chen, Yimin, An extended patch-based cellular automaton to simulate horizontal and vertical urban growth under the shared socioeconomic pathways, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 91, (2022); Chen, Yimin, Urban form simulation in 3D based on cellular automata and building objects generation, Building and Environment, 226, (2022); Chen, Yidan, Provincial and gridded population projection for China under shared socioeconomic pathways from 2010 to 2100, Scientific Data, 7, 1, (2020)","X.

However, since a dataset consisting of a huge amount of image and label pairs is required to utilize this technology, in most cases, a model trained with a dataset having similar characteristics is used for analysis, and as a result, the quality of segmentation is poor. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid model to leverage the strengths of each model in predicting specific classes. In particular, we first introduce a pre-processing operation to reduce the differences between the collected urban dataset and public dataset. Subsequently, we train several segmentation models with a pre-processed dataset then, based on the weight rule, the segmentation results are fused to create one segmentation map. To evaluate our proposal, we collected Google Street View images that do not have any labels and trained a model using the cityscapes dataset which contains foregrounds similar to the collected images. We quantitatively assessed its performance using the cityscapes dataset with ground truths and qualitatively evaluated the results of GSV data segmentation through user studies. Our approach outperformed existing methods and demonstrated the potential for accurate and efficient urban environment analysis using computer vision technology. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; hybrid model; image segmentation; streetscapes; urban environment analysis,,,,,,"Semyung University, (2022); Semyung University; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (103434); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI",This paper was supported by the Semyung University Research Grant of 2022.,"Rousselet, Jérôme, Assessing Species Distribution Using Google Street View: A Pilot Study with the Pine Processionary Moth, PLOS ONE, 8, 10, (2013); Rzotkiewicz, Amanda T., Systematic review of the use of Google Street View in health research: Major themes, strengths, weaknesses and possibilities for future research, Health and Place, 52, pp. 240-246, (2018); Yin, Li, Big data' for pedestrian volume: Exploring the use of Google Street View images for pedestrian counts, Applied Geography, 63, pp. 337-345, (2015); Berland, Adam, Google Street View shows promise for virtual street tree surveys, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 21, pp. 11-15, (2017); Liu, Dongwei, Establishing a citywide street tree inventory with street view images and computer vision techniques, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 100, (2023); Gupta, Kshama, Urban Neighborhood Green Index - A measure of green spaces in urban areas, Landscape and Urban Planning, 105, 3, pp. 325-335, (2012); Kim, Jae Hong, Decoding urban landscapes: Google street view and measurement sensitivity, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 88, (2021); Rundle, Andrew G., Using google street view to audit neighborhood environments, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 40, 1, pp. 94-100, (2011); Lu, Yi, The effect of street-level greenery on walking behavior: Evidence from Hong Kong, Social Science and Medicine, 208, pp. 41-49, (2018); Ye, Yu, Measuring daily accessed street greenery: A human-scale approach for informing better urban planning practices, Landscape and Urban Planning, 191, (2019)","S.

The calm wind area caused by inappropriate building arrangements results in pollutant accumulation. To realize a practical design and improve urban microclimate, we investigated the spatial relationship between roads, buildings, and open space using the machine learning technique. First, region growing and k-means clustering were employed to identify roads and buildings. Based on the image masking program, we selected training areas according to the land use map. Second, we used the multiple-point statistics technique to create new urban fabric images. Viewing the training image as a prior model, our program constantly reproduced morphological structures in the target area. We intensified the similarity with training areas and enriched the variability among generated images. Third, Hausdorff distance and multidimensional scaling were applied to achieve a quality examination. The proposed method was performed to fulfill an urban renovation design in Xi’an, China. Based on the historical record, we applied computational fluid dynamics to simulate air circulation and ventilation. The results indicate that the size of calm wind area is reduced.

Diverse forms of data collected from sensors in areas of high activity in the urban environment, particularly at street intersections, are valuable resources for researchers interpreting the dynamics between vehicles, pedestrians, and the built environment. In this paper, we present a high-resolution audio, video, and LiDAR dataset of three urban intersections in Brooklyn, New York, totaling almost 8 unique hours. The data were collected with custom Reconfigurable Environmental Intelligence Platform (REIP) sensors that were designed with the ability to accurately synchronize multiple video and audio inputs. The resulting data are novel in that they are inclusively multimodal, multi-angular, high-resolution, and synchronized. We demonstrate four ways the data could be utilized — (1) to discover and locate occluded objects using multiple sensors and modalities, (2) to associate audio events with their respective visual representations using both video and audio modes, (3) to track the amount of each type of object in a scene over time, and (4) to measure pedestrian speed using multiple synchronized camera views. In addition to these use cases, our data are available for other researchers to carry out analyses related to applying machine learning to understanding the urban environment (in which existing datasets may be inadequate), such as pedestrian-vehicle interaction modeling and pedestrian attribute recognition. Such analyses can help inform decisions made in the context of urban sensing and smart cities, including accessibility-aware urban design and Vision Zero initiatives. © 2023 by the authors.",computer vision; data synchronization; street-level imagery; urban intelligence; urban multimedia data; urban sensing,Pedestrian safety; Synchronization; Urban planning; Data synchronization; High resolution; Multi-modal; Multimedia data; Street-level imagery; Urban design; Urban environments; Urban intelligence; Urban multimedium data; Urban sensing; Computer vision,,,,,"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA","This work was supported in part by CNS-1828576, CNS-1544753, CNS-1229185, CCF-1533564, CNS-1730396, and CNS-1626098.

In addition, there are many other locales with no official guidance on the subject but have unofficially decriminalized sex work by designating specific areas in an urban landscape safe from law enforcement for commercial sex, by quietly ceasing to arrest sex sellers, or by declining to prosecute anyone selling or attempting to sell sex. Despite these efforts, it remains crucial to understand where in an urban area commercial sex exchanges occur—legalization and decriminalization may result in fewer arrests but is likely to increase the overall size of the sex market. This growth could result in an increase in sex trafficking victimization, which makes up the majority of commercial sex sellers in any domestic market. Given the distribution of prostitution activities in most communities, it is possible to use high-fidelity predictive models to identify intervention opportunities related to sex trafficking victimization. In this research, we construct several machine learning models and inform them with a range of known criminogenic factors to predict locations hosting high levels of prostitution. We demonstrate these methods in the city of Chicago, Illinois. The results of this exploratory analysis identified a range of explanatory factors driving prostitution activity throughout Chicago, and the best-performing model correctly predicted prostitution frequency with 94% accuracy. We conclude by exploring specific areas of under- and over-prediction throughout Chicago and discuss the implications of these results for allocating social support efforts. © 2022 by the authors.",crime forecasting; logistic regression; machine learning; neural network; prostitution prediction; spatial analysis,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (2039917)",This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2039917.,"Predictive Policing the Role of Crime Forecasting in Law Enforcement Operations, (2013); Meijer, Albert Jacob, Predictive Policing: Review of Benefits and Drawbacks, International Journal of Public Administration, 42, 12, pp. 1031-1039, (2019); Area Specific Crime Prediction Models; Tom-Jack, Quincy T., The role of geoprocessing in mapping crime using hot streets, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 8, 12, (2019); Yi, Fei, An Integrated Model for Crime Prediction Using Temporal and Spatial Factors, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, 2018-November, pp. 1386-1391, (2018); Icpsr Interuniv Consort Political Soc Res, (2015); Andresen, Martin A., Spatially Varying Unemployment and Crime Effects in the Long Run and Short Run, Professional Geographer, 73, 2, pp. 297-311, (2021); Mohler, George O., Marked point process hotspot maps for homicide and gun crime prediction in Chicago, International Journal of Forecasting, 30, 3, pp. 491-497, (2014); Ohyama, Tomoya, Applying Crime Prediction Techniques to Japan: A Comparison Between Risk Terrain Modeling and Other Methods, European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research, 24, 4, pp. 469-487, (2018); Chen, Xinyu, Crime prediction using Twitter sentiment and weather, pp. 63-68, (2015)","E.

Little is known about the spatiotemporal variations and potential drivers of sentiment based on big data. A total of 221,104 Weibo social media data were used to quantify daily sentiment in the Beijing metropolitan area during the COVID-19 pandemic from January 1, 2021 to March 8, 2022. Deep-learning natural language processing was used to extract this dataset to investigate the spatiotemporal sentiment patterns. The density of roads and buildings, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population, sky visibility factor, daily land surface temperature (LST), daily precipitation, and daily air pollution concentrations (CO, NO<inf>2</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf>) were explored as potential drivers of sentiment. Results show that (1) the holiday sentiment was 1.31% higher than on weekends and 4.61% higher than on weekdays. Extreme precipitation, air pollution, and COVID-19 lockdown measures have reduced sentiment. (2) The sentiment in spring was found to be the highest. The numbers of functional zones with high sentiment values (>0.8) in spring were 13.59%, in summer 34.48%, and in autumn 14.71%. (3) Sentiment was highest under conditions of moderate greenness (0.4<NDVI<0.6) and comfortable daily temperature (25 °C < LST<30 °C). (4) Sentiment was negatively associated with daily air pollutants, such as PM<inf>2.5</inf>, NO<inf>2</inf>, and CO. This paper presents the effectiveness of sentiment quantification based on social media data and deep-learning techniques.

Many studies have demonstrated the use of High-resolution satellite (HRS) imageries for mapping and monitoring of TOF in urban and rural landscapes. The conventional per-pixel classifier is not a suitable option for HRS data classification, owing to inherent high intra-class variability and high interclass similarity. In the present study, a convolution neural network-based approach was employed for TOF mapping using HRS images, predominantly in the urban landscape of Bengaluru city, India. We developed a semi-automated procedure for the generation of labelled training samples using object-based image analysis (OBIA), minimizing time requirement for input training data preparation for deep learning (DL) model development. These inputs were utilized to develop a DL model for the classification of TOF using U-Net, which is a semantic segmentation-based DL architecture. The results indicated that the model performed well for the classification of urban TOF with an overall classification accuracy of 89.65 percent and an F1 score of 93.03 percent, in comparison with OBIA (overall accuracy of 80.73 percent & F1 score of 86.44 percent). We demonstrated utilisation of a developed methodology for the assessment of TOF in a distinctive urban landscape, which can be extended to agriculture dominated regions in diverse landscapes. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",Convolution neural network (CNN); Deep learning (DL); High-resolution satellite (HRS) data; Object-based image analysis (OBIA); Semantic segmentation; Trees outside Forest (TOF); U-net,artificial neural network; image analysis; image resolution; satellite data; satellite imagery; segmentation; urban area; Bengaluru; India; Karnataka,,,,,,"The authors express their gratitude to Director, National Remote Sensing Centre, Indian Space Research Organization for his valuable guidance and constant encouragement during this study.

First, the geospatial information carried by comments is analyzed by GIS to obtain the image structure of the city; second, the picture data in the comments are divided into image types and the type ratio is calculated by the image semantic segmentation method based on deep full convolution neural network. Finally, the text data in the comments are extracted from the semantic word frequency analysis to evaluate the cultural service perception index words of the city image and combined with the analysis of the city image structure and the city image type so as to obtain the integrated comprehensive perception of the city image. The research shows that the introduction of big data and deep learning methods into city image research can make up for the shortcomings of traditional research samples, expand the dimension and breadth of urban cognition, reveal the social, cultural, and functional characteristics of the city, and is an important supplement to the five-element model of city image depicting the material form of the city.

These elements also provide information during navigation—particularly for people with cognitive difficulties or those unfamiliar with the geographical area. Nevertheless, some urban components are less eye-catching than intended because they are created and positioned irrespective of their surroundings. While quantitative measures such as eye tracking have been introduced, they help the initial or final stage of the urban design process and they involve expensive experiments. We introduce machine-learning-predicted visual saliency as iterative feedback for pedestrian attention during urban element design. Our user study focused on wayfinding signs as part of urban design and revealed that providing saliency prediction promoted a more efficient and helpful design experience without compromising usability. The saliency-guided design practice also contributed to producing more eye-catching and aesthetically pleasing urban elements.

To achieve these goals, a key role is played by all urban sectors, which can reduce environmental impacts and accelerate the green transition at larger scale. Intervening on a district scale obviously requires the evaluation of different aspects, taking into account both economic and non-economic criteria, as well as different points of view, involving all stakeholders. This paper proposes a multi-step evaluation procedure that extends the European manual-based Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to include the extra-economic benefits and the stakeholders’ opinion in the evaluation, according to the COmpoSIte Model for Assessment (COSIMA) method. This is the first application of COSIMA in the urban design sectors (i.e. buildings, water, public lighting, transportation and waste management) where different sustainable measures for a real case study located in Turin (Italy) were compared to define the most suitable transformation scenario according to multiple criteria. The results have shown how invasive scenarios allow achieving the greatest benefits, despite the huge initial costs of realization. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Decision support system (DSS); Multi-attribute value theory (MAVT); Simple multi-attribute rating technique extended (SMARTER); Urban sustainability,Artificial intelligence; Cost benefit analysis; COVID-19; Decision theory; Environmental impact; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Waste management; Built environment; Composite Modelling; Decision support system; Multi-attribute value theories; Multi-attribute value theory; Multi-attributes; Simple multi-attribute rating technique extended; Simple++; Sustainability project; Urban sustainability; Decision support systems,,,,,"European Commission, EC; Genome Institute of Singapore, GIS","The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is one of the main objectives worldwide. Not later than 2050, their reduction in Europe is recommended to be 80–95%, compared to the 1990 level (European Commission, 2011). Nowadays, urban areas are responsible for 70% of the total global emissions due to building and industrial sectors, followed by transport one. This is one of the main reasons why attention must be paid mainly to urban areas where human activities take place. The 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) defined by the United Nations stress on addressing climate change and building sustainable communities by 2030 (United Nations, 2017). SDGs 7 and 11 recognize the close link between cities and the energy sector to guarantee human well-being by reducing energy poverty and preserving the environment by reducing the effects of climate change. In this sense, many initiatives and new city concepts, such as Post-Carbon and Carbon Neutral Cities, were promoted to develop a more sustainable and resilient environment to tackle climate change (Nuñez et al., 2016). According to this new vision, all urban sectors can contribute to reducing emissions, and every possible action must be made from every side with an integrated approach. Climate change policies, improved energy efficiency and investment in renewables play a key role in addressing the volatility of energy prices that Europe has experienced in the recovery period after the COVID-19 outbreak (Li et al., 2022). To cope with the post-COVID-19 economic crisis, the European Commission has set up a resilience plan called Next Generation EU (NGEU) with a long-term financing plan of EUR 71 billion. Italy is the EU country that has benefited the most from NGEU funds. A large part of these funds will be spent to improve the country's green transition and have been included in the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NPRR) programme. To achieve progressive decarbonization, interventions have been planned to significantly increase the use of renewable energy sources, through direct investments and the simplification of authorisation procedures for renewables, and the reduction of energy demand in all urban sectors.There have been few studies on the theoretical and practical value of possible combinations of both techniques, particularly in the field of urban sustainability, energy and environmental policies. As suggested by Sanchez Martinez (2017), four already applied combinations of CBA and MCDA can be identified in the literature. The first category of approach is one in which the attributes of the MCDA are integrated within a CBA by monetizing them. This modification of attributes was done following the methodology proposed by Dones et al. (2005) in the External Costs of Energy (ExternE) project. The methodology involves an indirect monetization of the MCDA criteria based on the performance range of each criterion and the weight given to the performance of each criterion. This indirect evaluation is then added to the costs and benefits of the CBA, resulting in an extended CBA with elements that cannot be monetized a priori. The results of the application to the case study reveal the restrictive nature of the theoretical conditions that make the methodology hardly generalisable in terms of application. Moreover, with this approach, the obstacle of the difficulty of monetization characteristic of CBA is not overcome. The second approach involves integrating CBA profitability indicators (such as net present value, internal rate of return, benefit-cost ratio) into an MCDA-based decision support framework. This approach allows for a synthetic indicator, but it does not have the possibility to differentiate between tangible and intangible impacts. Napoli et al. (2020) integrate investment costs, Net Present Value (NPV) and payback period as criteria of an evaluation based on the ELECTRE TRI-nC method to cluster a set of alternative energy upgrading projects. This alternative is illustrated by Gühnemann et al. (2012) for the evaluation of a road infrastructure improvement investment scheme in Ireland.The proposed methodology adopts a multi-step approach (Fig. 1). Firstly, the energy (i.e. annual primary energy consumption) and environmental performances (i.e. annual CO2eq emissions and annual water consumptions) of the district in current and project scenarios are estimated, considering the following sectors: residential building, water (referred to usage in buildings), public and private transport, public lighting, and waste management. To this end, the state of affairs (SOA) of each sector is analyzed and characterized thanks to different databases and sources. In particular, the collection and management of spatial data can be supported by GIS (Abbasabadi and Mehdi Ashayeri, 2019). Different approaches are used to model SOA scenario for the identified urban sectors (Section 3.1). Once the SOA is set, sustainability measures (SMs) are defined for the different urban sectors, combined in actions and, subsequently, in different alternative scenarios, which are assessed, above all, in terms of their energy and environmental performance.","Abastante, Francesca, District energy choices: More than a monetary problem. a SDSS approach to define urban energy scenarios, Valori e Valutazioni, 2019, 22, pp. 109-120, (2019); Abbasabadi, Narjes, Urban energy use modeling methods and tools: A review and an outlook, Building and Environment, 161, (2019); Akin, Darçin, Multicriteria analysis of planned intercity bus terminals in the metropolitan city of Istanbul, Turkey, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 132, pp. 465-489, (2020); Ambrasaite, Inga, MCDA and risk analysis in transport infrastructure appraisals: The Rail Baltica case, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 20, pp. 944-953, (2011); Ballarini, Ilaria, Use of reference buildings to assess the energy saving potentials of the residential building stock: The experience of TABULA project, Energy Policy, 68, pp. 273-284, (2014); Barfod, Michael Bruhn, A new composite decision support framework for strategic and sustainable transport appraisals, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 72, pp. 1-15, (2015); Barfod, Michael Bruhn, Examination of decision support systems for composite CBA and MCDA assessments of transport infrastructure projects, Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, 648, pp. 167-176, (2011); Barfod, Michael Bruhn, Composite decision support by combining cost-benefit and multi-criteria decision analysis, Decision Support Systems, 51, 1, pp. 167-175, (2011); Barron, F.

The user-generated content already available on social media platforms in the form of images, comments, and ratings can be considered a rich source for collecting data concerning the tourists’ image of destinations and their collective perception of urban cultural heritage. Considering the amount of unstructured data on a large scale, artificial intelligence can construct structured feature vectors therefrom and significantly aid the analysis and collation processes compared to the traditional manual approach for mapping public perception of cultural heritage. This chapter presents a systematic literature review on the usage of user-generated content on social media platforms in the specific field of heritage management. A total of 431 records including research articles, conference proceedings, and book chapters that are available at SCOPUS and Web of Science were collected in 2020. After abstract screening and full-paper reviewing, 73 studies are included for qualitative synthesis to reflect the main issue of “how is User-Generated Content from social media platforms [computationally] understood for researching cultural heritage properties"". Information about the geographical distribution of the studies, the most frequently used social media platform, the span and size of collected and analysed user-generated content, the research objectives, focuses, methods, computational algorithms, and models, as well as the distinction between baseline and activated scenarios, has been identified, categorized, and/or summarized. These key aspects coded for the systematic literature review process are eventually mapped on a 2D space using the Multi-Dimensional Scaling algorithm to indicate the co-occurring associations among the aspects. It is also found that although only a small proportion of the included studies declared explicitly that their study case is a cultural heritage property, a majority of them were conducted with at least one study case in a city where one or more World Heritage properties are located. In other words, those studies were concerned with cultural heritage planning or management issues without explicit recognition.

The study is framed within the theory of transect analysis. The goal of this experiment was to compare an analogical transect analysis method (AT) to Machine Learning one (MLT) to understand (1) what kind of contribution the latter approach can provide to the development of transect analysis methodologies, and (2) if and how it can connect digitally generated site analysis to local knowledge. The experiment’s findings highlight the ability of the ML algorithms to find noticeable patterns of built environment from aerial imagery. However, local knowledge is indispensable to interpret results in a meaningful way. The combination of the two approaches emphasizes the complementary nature of them and shows how ML methods can be a tool at the service of communities. © 2023, Maggioli S.p.a..

With the city's ongoing expansion, residents' expectations for their living standards rise along with the consideration given to streetscape quality. Deep learning methods offer more precise solutions for researchers. While previous studies extensively explored street landscapes encompassing assessment, perception, and ecology, deep learning has not yet been employed. Thus, we examined street landscape determinants compared to prior work. In this study, we probed factors influencing street landscape quality, and 2) used the Delphi method to identify quality preferences. The results revealed four primary enhancement strategies. Factors were obtained via deep learning as street landscape preferences and evaluated with the Delphi method in five dimensions: architectural facade, street dimensions, street furniture, street greening, and sunlight exposure (totaling 16 factors). These findings can be used to forecast street design quality and suggest ways to enhance urban landscapes, especially on less optimal streets. © 2023 IEEE.",deep learning; Delphi method; streets; streetscape quality; urbanization,Learning systems; Deep learning; Delphi method; Landscape preferences; Learning methods; Learning technology; Living standards; Precise solutions; Streetscape quality; Urban environments; Urbanization,,,,,,,"Fang, Chuangling Lin, Modeling regional sustainable development scenarios using the Urbanization and Eco-environment Coupler: Case study of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, China, Science of the Total Environment, 689, pp. 820-830, (2019); Wang, Liyan, Spatial and Temporal Changes of Arable Land Driven by Urbanization and Ecological Restoration in China, Chinese Geographical Science, 29, 5, pp. 809-819, (2019); Pataki, Diane E., The Benefits and Limits of Urban Tree Planting for Environmental and Human Health, Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 9, (2021); Wang, Ruoyu, Dynamic greenspace exposure and residents’ mental health in Guangzhou, China: From over-head to eye-level perspective, from quantity to quality, Landscape and Urban Planning, 215, (2021); Ibrahim, Mohamed R., Understanding cities with machine eyes: A review of deep computer vision in urban analytics, Cities, 96, (2020); Tao, Yilei, Measuring the Correlation between Human Activity Density and Streetscape Perceptions: An Analysis Based on Baidu Street View Images in Zhengzhou, China, Land, 11, 3, (2022); Kaushik, Dushyant, Utilizing Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Cybesecurity: An Innovative Approach, pp. 271-294, (2021); Zuurbier, Moniek, Street temperature and building characteristics as determinants of indoor heat exposure, Science of the Total Environment, 766, (2021); Journal of Anhui Jianzhu University, (2021); Jstor, (1962)",,"Meen, T.-.H.",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"3rd IEEE International Conference on Social Sciences and Intelligence Management, SSIM 2023",2023-12-15 through 2023-12-17,Taichung,198342,,9.80E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Despite its significant value, the availability of such datasets often faces limitations due to privacy concerns, proprietary barriers, and quality inconsistencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents a synthetic trajectory dataset with high fidelity, offering a general solution to these data accessibility issues. Specifically, the proposed dataset adopts a diffusion model as its synthesizer, with the primary aim of accurately emulating the spatial-temporal behavior of the original trajectory data. These synthesized data can retain the geo-distribution and statistical properties characteristic of real-world datasets. Through rigorous analysis and case studies, we validate the high similarity and utility between the proposed synthetic trajectory dataset and real-world counterparts. Such validation underscores the practicality of synthetic datasets for urban mobility analysis and advocates for its wider acceptance within the research community. Finally, we publicly release the trajectory synthesizer and datasets, aiming to enhance the quality and availability of synthetic trajectory datasets and encourage continued contributions to this rapidly evolving field.

The ability to predict parking slot availability has far-reaching implications for urban mobility, traffic congestion mitigation, economic efficiency, and overall quality of life. This research paper presents a comprehensive approach that leverages deep learning and machine learning techniques, including neural network models, to address the multifaceted problem of parking slot prediction. Unique to this research is the integration of federated learning, a distributed approach that preserves data privacy and security while aggregating knowledge from spatial and temporal data sources. The research unfolds in two primary stages: spatial and temporal. In the spatial case, models are trained to understand the intricate relationships between parking slot occupancy and the physical characteristics of the environment. Simultaneously, in the temporal case, models capture temporal patterns in parking slot occupancy, considering variables such as time of day and seasonal variations.Federated aggregation combines the models’ insights, uniting the knowledge acquired from these diverse data sources. The result is a final model that harmonizes spatial and temporal understanding, while respecting data privacy and maintaining data security. This innovative approach results in a unified model that provides a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of parking slot prediction, with federated learning techniques safeguarding data integrity. © 2023 IEEE.",Deep Learning; Federated Aggregation; Federated Learning; Neural Network; Spatial Regression; Time Series Analysis; Traffic Congestion; Vehicular Traffic,Deep learning; Economic efficiency; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Time series analysis; Data-source; Federated aggregation; Federated learning; Neural-networks; Parking management; Spatial regression; Time-series analysis; Urban parking; Vehicular traffic; Traffic congestion,,,,,,,"Krishnan, Prabhakar, VARMAN: Multi-plane security framework for software defined networks, Computer Communications, 148, pp. 215-239, (2019); Raghunath, Karthik, Towards A Secure SDN Architecture, (2018); Kim, Hyeyoung, A load balancing scheme based on deep-learning in IoT, Cluster Computing, 20, 1, pp. 873-878, (2017); Krishnan, Prabhakar, MUD-Based Behavioral Profiling Security Framework for Software-Defined IoT Networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 9, 9, pp. 6611-6622, (2022); Traffic Prediction Using Machine Learning, (2022); Medina-Salgado, Boris A., Urban traffic flow prediction techniques: A review, Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems, 35, (2022); Nuli, Sadguna, Real-Time Traffic Prediction Using Neural Networks, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 1086, 1, (2022); Qi, Yangyang, Research on Traffic Congestion Forecast Based on Deep Learning, Information (Switzerland), 14, 2, (2023); Kashyap, Anirudh Ameya, Traffic flow prediction models–A review of deep learning techniques, Cogent Engineering, 9, 1, (2022); Khan, Noor Ullah, Traffic Flow Prediction: An Intelligent Scheme for Forecasting Traffic Flow Using Air Pollution Data in Smart Cities with Bagging Ensemble, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 7, (2022)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"2nd International Conference on Automation, Computing and Renewable Systems, ICACRS 2023",2023-12-11 through 2023-12-12,Pudukkottai,196917,,9.80E+12,,,English,"Int.

While medium-resolution Landsat data are excellent for such analysis, the existence of mixed pixels, which reflect a composite spectral response of the component classes, limits pixel-based categorization. Hence, to yield the full potential of the Landsat data, the proportions of classes (subpixels) in these mixed pixels need to be estimated which gives individual class proportions. This study proposes a subpixel classification method that leverages the temporal overlap of Landsat-5 TM and Resourcesat-1 LISS-IV sensors. The 30-m resolution Landsat-5 TM imagery is available from 1985 to 2011 and the 5-m resolution Resourcesat-1 LISS-IV imagery is available from 2003 to 2013. Hence, a direct mapping from Landsat-5 TM to Resourcesat-1 LISS-IV is highly feasible to estimate the percentage of built-up and vegetation fraction in each 30-m resolution cell. In the chapter, a convolutional neural network was trained to predict fractional land cover maps from 30m Landsat-5 TM satellite data. The reference land cover fractions were estimated from a hard-classified LISS-IV image for Bengaluru from 2011. Further, the generalizability of the proposed model was demonstrated using satellite data for Mumbai (2009). For both Bengaluru (2011) and Mumbai (2009) datasets, the mean absolute error falls within the range of 7.2%–11.3% for both built-up and vegetation fraction prediction at the 30m cell scale. The chapter highlights the subpixel classification by successfully simulating the sensor behavior of Landsat-5 TM, which can effectively be used for time series analysis to monitor the changes within the urban landscape. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

Contemporary frameworks, such as the Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) proposed by the Joint Authorities for Rulemaking of Unmanned Systems (JARUS), predominantly use static methodologies for estimating population density, implicitly presuming uniform population distribution. Such assumptions potentially introduce inaccuracies in the quantification of third-party risks due to the dismissal of temporal fluctuations in population distribution. This study seeks to address this gap by employing Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a bio-inspired algorithm traditionally used to solve optimization problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Singapore serves as the case study in this context, where bus stops within neighbourhood subzones are assigned as network nodes. The ACO algorithm, coupled with an appropriate heuristic data input, is employed to induce non-uniformity in population distribution. Furthermore, the study introduces a metric, termed 'population exposure', that acts as the heuristic data input to the ACO algorithm, and is devised to encapsulate dynamic patterns of population inflow and outflow. Preliminary findings, primarily conveyed through visualizations, show promising alignment with qualitative assumptions regarding population distribution about time and locale. This initial assessment could herald a nuanced approach to UAS operational risk assessments, accommodating the dynamic and non-uniform nature of urban population distribution. © 2023 IEEE.",Ant Colony Optimization; Non-Uniform Population; Risk Analysis; UAM; UAS,Ant colony optimization; Antennas; Artificial intelligence; Commercial vehicles; Population distribution; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Traveling salesman problem; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Data input; Non-uniform; Non-uniform population; Risks assessments; Safety measures; System risk assessment; UAM; Unmanned aircraft system; Urban environments; Risk analysis,,,,,"National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Nanyang Technological University, NTU; Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, CAAS","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore, and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, under the Aviation Transformation Programme.

Remote sensing images obtain terrain information which can be used to extract various urban features of land use and land cover to identify the changes. These images enable us to perform feature extraction and classification. Several powerful and successful mechanisms have been proposed to perform supervised satellite image categorization of remotely sensed satellite multispectral data. In supervised satellite image classification, machine learning algorithms have become quite popular due to their good accuracy.This paper aims to study the performance of the Convolution Neural Network's VGG-16 and ResNet-34 algorithms for identifying Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) using supervised classification.Based on the remotely sensed multispectral Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images the LULCC is found by performing supervised image classification on the study region which is Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for the years 2000, 2010 and 2020. Four classes as Water, Built-up, Vegetation and Barrenland were identified to perform classification.The overall accuracy, the producer's accuracy, the user's accuracy, and standard kappa coefficient were also calculated. The training loss, validation loss and training accuracy were also studied. The various LULCC thematic maps and accuracy assessment results were obtained for the year 2000, 2010 and 2020. © 2023 IEEE.",Convolution Neural Network (CNN); Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC); Visual Geometry Group (VGG)- VGG-16 and Residual Network (ResNet) ResNet-34,,,,,,,,"Xu, Haifeng, Study on Land-Use Change and Prediction of Chongming Dongtan Wetland in Shanghai City, Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing, 50, 12, pp. 2429-2445, (2022); Yu, Xingrui, Deep learning in remote sensing scene classification: a data augmentation enhanced convolutional neural network framework, GIScience and Remote Sensing, 54, 5, pp. 741-758, (2017); Final Regional Plan Mmr April 2021 Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority Regional Plan Maharashtra Gov in Microsoft Word 2, (2023); Https Www Usgs Gov about about Us; Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition, (2014); International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications Ijsrp, (2019); Corr, (2015); Landsat 5 Landsat Science Nasa Gov, (2023); Landsat 5 TM Satellite Imagery Overview and Characteristics, (2023); Landsat 8 Bands Landsat Science Nasa Gov Text Courtesy Charlie Loyd Mapbox Original Post Titled Putting Landsat 8 S Bands to Work",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS),"2023 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2023",2023-07-16 through 2023-07-21,Pasadena,193756,21536996; 21537003,1424412129; 0780312406; 9780780390508; 9798350320107; 9781728163741; 9781424495658; 9781665427920; 9781479911141; 9781479957750; 9781479979295,IGRSE,,English,Dig Int Geosci Remote Sens Symp (IGARSS),Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178381578

Drawing upon a range of urban disciplines and case studies, the chapters reveal the multitude of repercussions that AI is having on urban society, urban infrastructure, urban governance, urban planning and urban sustainability. Contributors also examine how the city, far from being a passive recipient of new technologies, is influencing and reframing AI through subtle processes of co-constitution. The book advances three main contributions and arguments: First, it provides empirical evidence of the emergence of a post-smart trajectory for cities in which new material and decision-making capabilities are being assembled through multiple AIs. Second, it stresses the importance of understanding the mutually constitutive relations between the new experiences enabled by AI technology and the urban context. Third, it engages with the concepts required to clarify the opaque relations that exist between AI and the city, as well as how to make sense of these relations from a theoretical perspective. Artificial Intelligence and the City offers a state-of-the-art analysis and review of AI urbanism, from its roots to its global emergence. It cuts across several disciplines and will be a useful resource for undergraduates and postgraduates in the fields of urban studies, urban planning, geography, architecture, urban design, science and technology studies, sociology and politics. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Federico Cugurullo, Federico Caprotti, Matthew Cook, Andrew Karvonen, Pauline McGuirk and Simon Marvin; individual chapters, the contributors.

However, as the society progress toward a post-COVID stage, the prevailing decentralized delivery systems and location-based services, the growing trend of working from home, with citizens’ shifting preference of de-appreciating densities and gathering, have not only changed the possible spatial distribution of opportunities, resources, consumption and amenities, but also transformed people’s preference regarding desirable urban spatial qualities, value of amenities, and working opportunities [2, 3]. This research presents a systematic method to evaluate the perceived trade-off between urban spatial qualities and urban utilities such as amenities, transportation, and monetary opportunities by urban residence in the post-COVID society. The outcome of the research will become a valid tool to drive and evaluate urban design strategies based on the potential self-organization of work-life patterns and social profiles in the designated neighbourhood. To evaluate the subjective perception of the urban residence, the study started with a comparative survey by asking residence to compare two randomly selected urban contexts in a data base of 398 contexts sampled across Hong Kong and state their living preference under the presumption of following scenarios: 1. working from home; 2. working in city centre offices. Core information influencing the spatial equilibrium are provided in the comparable urban context such as street views, housing price, housing space, travel time to city centre, adjacency to public transport and amenities, etc. Each context is given a preference score calculated with Microsoft TrueSkill Bayesian ranking algorithm [4] based on the comparison survey of two scenarios. The 398 contexts are further analysed via GIS and image processing, to be deconstructed into numerical values describing main features for each of the context that influence urban design strategies such as composition of spatial features, amenity allocation, adjacency to city centre and public transportations. Machine learning models are trained with the numerical values of urban features as input and two preference scores for the two working scenarios as the output. The correlation heat maps are used to identify main urban features and its p-value that influence residence’s preference under two working scenarios in post–COVID era. The same model could also be applied to inform the direction of urban design strategies to construct a sustainable community for each type of working population and validate the design strategies via predicting its competitiveness in attracting residence and developing target industries. © 2023, The Author(s).",Data driven urban design; Machine learning; Post-COVID; Sustainable communities; Urban data analysis,Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Housing; Machine learning; Quality control; Spatial distribution; Telecommunication services; Travel time; Urban transportation; City centers; Data driven; Data driven urban design; Design strategies; Machine-learning; Post-COVID; Spatial quality; Sustainable communities; Urban data analyse; Urban design; Location based services,,,,,,,"undefined; Salazar Miranda, Arianna, Desirable streets: Using deviations in pedestrian trajectories to measure the value of the built environment, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 86, (2021); Qiu, Waishan, Subjectively measured streetscape perceptions to inform urban design strategies for Shanghai, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 10, 8, (2021); Trueskill 2 an Improved Bayesian Skill Rating System, (2018); Wang, Jianguo, Vision of China's future urban construction reform: In the perspective of comprehensive prevention and control for multi disasters, Sustainable Cities and Society, 64, (2021); Urban Studies, (2021); Quantitative Evaluation on Street Vitality A Case Study of Zhoujiadu Community in Shanghai, (2021); Lynch K 1964 the Image of the City; undefined; Rode, Philipp, Accessibility in Cities: Transport and Urban Form, Lecture Notes in Mobility, pp. 239-273, (2017)","D.

The “AI Urban Voids'' project is defined as a data-driven approach to analyze and predict the strategic location for urban uses in the addition of amenities within the city. The location of these urban amenities is evaluated based on predictions and scores followed by a series of urban analyses and simulations using K-Means clustering.

Sensitivity analysis of optimisation results from morphology-based, non-linear urban models can be ineffective due to computational costs limiting the number of samples possible, and large ranges of search due to users’ inexperience with the model parameters. In response to these challenges, this paper puts forward a method of identifying well-performing parameter ranges, and tests three parameter-clustering experiments to improve optimization efficiency and quality of outputs in comparison with a baseline NSGA-III optimization. These methods are applied to results from an urban design optimization tool implemented within the context of Singaporean urbanism.

In order to foster new ways of sustainable urban regeneration, it is essential to identify public green areas in which to promote cultural-based spatial regeneration processes consistent with the Circular Economy model. Different visions of urban landscape reform give an interpretation of these issues based on the model of the ‘15-Minute City’ services and proximity logics contribute to the construction of enabling contexts, i.e. contexts in which the human beings are enabled to be active subjects, capable of pursuing their own well-being, that of their community and of their ecosystem. In particular, the ecosystem assets of cities can be read as a multitude of local proximity ecosystems or ‘Minimum Ecological Units’ (MEUs). Collaborative analysis of the use of MEUs can be the basis of Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) which, through standardised techniques for accessing, understanding and interpreting data, facilitate stakeholders in decision-making processes. Starting from the results obtained by the multidisciplinary Collective “Needle Agopuntura Urbana”, in the collaborative process of urban regeneration developed within the Needle Scampia (Naples) Living Lab, the contribution proposes the integration of Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tools with Participatory GIS (P-GIS) collaborative spatial survey practices. The proposed methodology aims to define a SDSS able to provide decision-makers and communities with a tool capable of considering qualitative factors with respect to the transformative potential of MEUs as well as providing the possibility of balancing these factors with quantitative dimensions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Circular regeneration; Minimum Ecological Units (MEU); Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA); Participatory GIS (P-GIS); Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS),Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Needles; Urban planning; Circular regeneration; Ecological units; Minimum ecological unit; Multi-criteria decision analyse; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Participatory GIS; Spatial decision support system; Spatial decision support systems; Urban regeneration; Ecosystems,,,,,,,"Bosone, Martina, The Circular City Implementation: Cultural Heritage and Digital Technology, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12794 LNCS, pp. 40-62, (2021); Randrup, T.

These phenomena represent a risk for cultural heritage conservation, with negative consequences for local economies. To move from the analysis of climate impacts to adaptation measures and governance tools, it is necessary to deal with the different characteristics of the urban context in its physical, historical, cultural, and socio-economic components. The paper focuses on the collaboration between UNIGE Architecture and Design Department (DAD), and Colouree S.r.l. that has developed an analytical platform that uses artificial intelligence, geo-referenced data, and automated analysis to define the characteristics of the urban context. The aim of the research is the identification of parameters and solutions to respond to the effects of climate change in the urban environment, considering risk levels and context settlement; alongside the climatic skills, also the architects’ skills in environmental technologies, urban landscape, and cultural heritage have been given relevance. DAD aims to capitalize on the previous and ongoing experiences of Colouree, offering scientific and methodological support, to reach the definition of a detailed settlement analysis, providing indications on the risks associated with the main predictable effects (extreme weather events, heat island effect, water availability). The expected results will define a methodological structure to create a sensitivity mapping to meteorological phenomena, based on the data support from Colouree towards the carrying capacity of the urban fabric, making information more accessible thanks to the data visualization and web-based mapping, including, among the stakeholders, not only experts but also professionals and citizens. © 2023, The Author(s).",Climate change; Data-driven design; Key performance indicators; Resilience; Smart city,,,,,,"Université de Genève, UNIGE","Research carried out in the context of: Operational Programme National (PON) “Research and Innovation” 2014–2020, Green, Researcher Type A (RTDa PON), UNIGE, DAD.","Climate Change and Air Pollution, (2018); In Dima A Ed Resilience and Economic Intelligence Through Digitalization and Big Data Analytics, (2021); undefined; Chan, Albert P.C., Key performance indicators for measuring construction success, Benchmarking, 11, 2, pp. 203-221, (2004); Côté, Isabelle M., Rethinking ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change, PLOS Biology, 8, 7, (2010); Hughes, Sara M., Accountability and data-driven urban climate governance, Nature Climate Change, 10, 12, pp. 1085-1090, (2020); undefined; Contribution of Working Group II to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2022); Quijano, Ana, Towards Sustainable and Smart Cities: Replicable and KPI-Driven Evaluation Framework, Buildings, 12, 2, (2022); Technical Report, (2021)","M.

Reliable and up-to-date information on urban vegetation is therefore needed as a basis for sustainable urban design and regular tasks such as vegetation maintenance. Mobile laser scanning (MLS), i. e., the use of vehicle-mounted laser scanners, offers strong potential for capturing 3D point clouds of road environments on a large scale at a low cost. In this paper, the potential and challenges of using MLS for vegetation mapping are discussed. To lay a foundation for MLS-based inventories of roadside vegetation, a concept for the automatic detection and analysis of vegetation in MLS point clouds using deep learning is presented. The proposed workflow covers vegetation detection and classification, delineation of individual trees, and estimation of tree attributes. In a case study, an initial implementation of the work-flow is tested using MLS datasets from two German cities and the results are evaluated through visual inspection. It is demonstrated that the proposed deep-learning approach is able to detect and classify vegetation in MLS point clouds of complex urban road scenes. When delineating individual trees, accurate results are obtained for solitary trees and trees with little canopy overlap, while the delineation of trees with strongly overlapping canopies needs further improvement in some cases. The results indi-cate that geometric tree attributes such as tree height and trunk diameter can be accurately estimated from MLS point clouds if the accuracy of the preceding processing steps is sufficiently high. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH ·.",deep learning; LiDAR; mobile mapping; tree inventory; Vegetation mapping,,,,,,"(19F2210, TWIN4ROAD); (033L305); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01IS22062)","Funding text 1: We thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback as well as AllTerra Deutschland GmbH and the Department for Geoinformation, Surveying and Cadastre of the City of Essen for providing mobile mapping data.

We illustrate the merits of our approach by explaining computer vision models used to analyse street imagery, which are now widely used in GeoAI and urban analytics. Such explanations are important in urban analytics as researchers and practioners are increasingly reliant on it for decision making. Finally, we perform a user study that demonstrate our approach can be used by non-expert users, who might not be machine learning experts, to be more confident and to better understand the behaviour of image-based classifiers/regressors for street view analysis. Furthermore, the method can potentially be used as an engagement tool to visualise how public spaces can plausibly look like. The limited realism of the counterfactuals is a concern which we hope to improve in the future. © 2023 The Author(s).

As the main complementary means of producing high-resolution DEMs, the DEM super-resolution (SR) method based on deep learning has reached a bottleneck. The reason for this phenomenon is that the DEM super-resolution method based on deep learning lacks a part of the global information it requires. Specifically, the multilevel aggregation process of deep learning has difficulty sufficiently capturing the low-level features with dependencies, which leads to a lack of global relationships with high-level information. To address this problem, we propose a global-information-constrained deep learning network for DEM SR (GISR). Specifically, our proposed GISR method consists of a global information supplement module and a local feature generation module. The former uses the Kriging method to supplement global information, considering the spatial autocorrelation rule. The latter includes a residual module and the PixelShuffle module, which is used to restore the detailed features of the terrain. Compared with the bicubic, Kriging, SRCNN, SRResNet, and TfaSR methods, the experimental results of our method show a better ability to retain terrain features, and the generation effect is more consistent with the ground truth DEM. Meanwhile, compared with the deep learning method, the RMSE of our results is improved by 20.5% to 68.8%. © 2023 by the authors.",DEM super-resolution; Kriging; ResNet; spatial autocorrelation,Autocorrelation; Deep learning; E-learning; Learning systems; Optical resolving power; Surveying; DEM super-resolution; Digital elevation model; Global informations; High-resolution DEM; Kriging; Learning network; Resnet; Spatial autocorrelations; Superresolution; Superresolution methods,,,,,"(42122025); (GLAB2022ZR06); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41871305); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871305]; the Opening Fund of Key Laboratory of Geological Survey and Evaluation of Ministry of Education [GLAB2022ZR06] and National Science Foundation for Outstanding Young Scholars [42122025].,"Passalacqua, Paola, Testing space-scale methodologies for automatic geomorphic feature extraction from lidar in a complex mountainous landscape, Water Resources Research, 46, 11, (2010); Kenward, Tracey C., Effects of digital elevation model accuracy on hydrologic predictions, Remote Sensing of Environment, 74, 3, pp. 432-444, (2000); Huang, Chang, DEM-based modification of pixel-swapping algorithm for enhancing floodplain inundation mapping, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 35, 1, pp. 365-381, (2014); Kellndorfer, Josef Martin, Vegetation height estimation from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and National Elevation Datasets, Remote Sensing of Environment, 93, 3, pp. 339-358, (2004); Chen, Dingyuan, Urban road mapping based on an end-to-end road vectorization mapping network framework, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 178, pp. 345-365, (2021); Chen, Zixuan, Convolutional neural network based dem super resolution, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 41, pp. 247-250, (2016); Zhu, Di, Spatial interpolation using conditional generative adversarial neural networks, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 34, 4, pp. 735-758, (2020); Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, (2013); Zhang, Yifan, Comparison of DEM Super-Resolution Methods Based on Interpolation and Neural Networks, Sensors, 22, 3, (2022); Li, Jin, A review of comparative studies of spatial interpolation methods in environmental sciences: Performance and impact factors, Ecological Informatics, 6, 3-4, pp. 228-241, (2011)","Z.

The deep learning-based image semantic segmentation method is an important part of computer vision technology, which provides a new method for visual quality evaluation of urban landscape. In this chapter, the core area of Shenyang (within the first ring road) was chosen as the research object, and the street panorama was extracted using Baidu Map API. DeepLabv3+ semantic segmentation model was applied to semantic segmentation of the sample photos; the five spatial characteristic indices of public visual perception of urban streetscape were calculated: green space factor, sky view factor, building area ratio, vehicle occurrence rate, and pedestrian occurrence rate. A regression model of urban streetscape visual quality was constructed by correlation and regression analysis of SBE of urban streetscape and spatial characteristic indices through using typical sample photos. This study combines the spatial characteristic indices of all samples in the core area to calculate the visual quality of streetscape in the core area of Shenyang, establishes the dataset of the street spatial visual quality, explores the correlation between urban spatial characteristics and spatial visual perception, and provides suggestions for urban development planning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Semantic segmentation; Street spatial characteristic; Streetscape images; Visual quality,,,,,,,,"Carmona, Matthew, Street appeal: The value of street improvements, Progress in Planning, 126, pp. 1-51, (2018); Li, Xiaojiang, Mapping urban landscapes along streets using google street view, Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography, pp. 341-356, (2017); Salesses, Philip, The Collaborative Image of The City: Mapping the Inequality of Urban Perception, PLOS ONE, 8, 7, (2013); Zhang, Fan, Measuring human perceptions of a large-scale urban region using machine learning, Landscape and Urban Planning, 180, pp. 148-160, (2018); Cavalcante, André Borges, Measuring streetscape complexity based on the statistics of local contrast and spatial frequency, PLOS ONE, 9, 2, (2014); Ye, Yu, The visual quality of streets: A human-centred continuous measurement based on machine learning algorithms and street view images, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 46, 8, pp. 1439-1457, (2019); Frank, Lawrence Douglas, The built environment and human activity patterns: Exploring the impacts of urban form on public health, Journal of Planning Literature, 16, 2, pp. 202-218, (2001); Jackson, Richard J.J., Health and the built environment: 10 years after, American Journal of Public Health, 103, 9, pp. 1542-1544, (2013); McGinn, Aileen P., Exploring associations between physical activity and perceived and objective measures of the built environment, Journal of Urban Health, 84, 2, pp. 162-184, (2007); Ewing, Reid H., Measuring the unmeasurable: Urban design qualities related to walkability, Journal of Urban Design, 14, 1, pp. 65-84, (2009)","D.

Monitoring and understanding urban flooding in a highly localized scale is a challenging task due to the complicated urban landscape, intricate hydraulic process, and the lack of high-quality and resolution data. The emerging smart city technology such as monitoring cameras provides an unprecedented opportunity to address the data issue. However, estimating water ponding extents on land surfaces based on monitoring footage is unreliable using the traditional segmentation technique because the boundary of the water ponding, under the influence of varying weather, background, and illumination, is usually too fuzzy to identify, and the oblique angle and image distortion in the video monitoring data prevents georeferencing and object-based measurements. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised segmentation scheme for surface water extent recognition from the footage of an oblique monitoring camera. The semi-supervised segmentation algorithm was found suitable to determine the water boundary and the monoplotting method was successfully applied to georeference the pixels of the monitoring video for the virtual quantification of the local drainage process. The correlation and mechanism-based analysis demonstrate the value of the proposed method in advancing the understanding of local drainage hydraulics. The workflow and created methods in this study have a great potential to study other street-level and earth surface processes. © 2022 The Author(s).

This research aims to identify the microclimatic dissimilarities between courtyards in terms of tempering seasonal–diurnal thermal extremes and enriching ground-level thermal textures. The methodology included field measurements in summer-2021 and winter-2022 in Cambridge, UK; microclimatic simulations of 107 courtyards in ENVI-met and model validations; and machine learning-driven clustering using Super Organising Maps (SuperSOM). The results indicate that the diurnal thermal range of the spatial-UTCI mean in summer (DTR(M)<24∘C) is double that in winter (DTR(M)<12∘C); meanwhile the maximum spatial-UTCI deviation is three times as significant (δ>3∘Cat 7:00 BST versus δ>1∘Cat 12:00 GMT). SuperSOM analysis was performed using K-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering to partition all courtyards into seven subclusters on its graph-lattice structure. Clusters Km_I, Hac_I, and Hac_IV feature a positive synergy between the thermal-tempering and thermal-enriching potentials. In contrast, the other four clusters exhibit conflicting scenarios during the day and night across the two seasons analysed. These data-driven outcomes enabled us to optimise spatial and landscape strategies for designing and retrofitting courtyard microclimates, contributing to the current discussions on climate-responsive and sensation-inclusive design in historical urban contexts. © 2022 The Author(s)",Courtyard; Historical urban contexts; Machine learning; Microclimate; Thermal diversity; Thermal tempering,Concentration (process); K-means clustering; Tempering; Textures; Cambridge; Courtyard; Historical urban context; Machine-learning; Microclimate; Performance; Thermal; Thermal diversity; Thermal tempering; Urban context; Machine learning; climate modeling; ground-based measurement; machine learning; microclimate; model validation; performance assessment; strategic approach; temperature profile; urban climate; urban design; urban planning; Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; Cambridgeshire; England; United Kingdom,,,,,,"Funding text 1: We would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the time and effort devoted by the editors and reviewers to improving the quality of this published work.

Some firms are located close to wealthy neighborhoods and far from competitors, but other firms do not enjoy these advantages. The probability that a household selects a certain firm to patronize depends on that firm’s price and its distance from the household. The firms have almost no information about the urban market they inhabit, but they can experiment with prices and learn what actions lead to higher profits. Firms that experience persistent losses go out of business. When transportation costs are low, households shop aggressively and the result that emerges resembles perfect competition. When transportation costs are high, households shop less aggressively, which gives firms greater market power. The results here more closely resemble monopolistic competition, with more firms surviving, higher prices and higher profits. However, this collusion is implicit, as there is no mechanism for the firms to communicate or explicitly collude with each other. I validate the model by conducting a Probit analysis of the factors that determine firm survival. I also conduct an econometric analysis of the factors that determine a firm’s price, quantity sold, and profit. Firms locating close to rival have a higher probability of going out of business. If these firms do survive, on average their profits are no different than the profits of firms that are not located close to a rival. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Agent-based simulations; Firm location; Firm survival; Machine learning; Urban retail markets,,,,,,,The author wishes to thank Steven O.

This study investigates the impact of LU/LC class changes on LST based on the distribution of UHI spot maps in Mansoura city, Egypt, using Landsat satellite images from 1991 to 2021. Based on these estimated LU/LC and LST maps, machine learning algorithms, cellular automata, and artificial neural network approaches were used to predict future changes in LU/LC and LST for 2031. The influence of UHI may be quantified using the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). The geographic information system (GIS) add-in UHI calculator ArcGIS tool was created because we considered the spatial consequences of employing remote sensing data. This tool includes all the methods and procedures for calculating LST and UHI. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between LST and normalized difference built-up index and a negative correlation between LST and normalized difference vegetation index. The forecasted results for 2031 also show that the built-up area will grow roughly 20%, with a considerable drop in vegetation by 18%. If the city's fast urbanization continues, more than 40% of Mansoura will have land surface temperatures above 45°C by 2031. Avoiding dense built-up areas and growing vegetation spaces remain efficient means of minimizing the influence of UTFVI in urban construction practice. Therefore, this research will help to achieve sustainable development by providing essential insights into the complicated interplay between diverse aspects of urban settings and promoting city competency. © Geoinformatics International.",Artificial Neural Network; Land Surface Temperature; Machine Learning; Prediction; Urban Heat Island,algorithm; ArcGIS; automation; climate effect; heat island; land cover; land surface; land use change; machine learning; mapping method; satellite imagery; surface temperature; sustainable development; urban climate; urban design; urban development; vegetation cover; Egypt; Mansoura,,,,,,,"Global Megatrends Mapping the Forces that Affect Us all, (2020); Kleemann, Janina, Assessing driving forces of land use and land cover change by a mixed-method approach in north-eastern Ghana, West Africa, Journal of Environmental Management, 196, pp. 411-442, (2017); Bratley, Kelsee H., Modeling urban encroachment on the agricultural land of the Eastern Nile Delta using remote sensing and a GIS-Based Markov Chain Model, Land, 7, 4, (2018); Hatab, Assem Abu, Urban sprawl, food security and agricultural systems in developing countries: A systematic review of the literature, Cities, 94, pp. 129-142, (2019); Sonnino, Roberta, The new geography of food security: Exploring the potential of urban food strategies, Geographical Journal, 182, 2, pp. 190-200, (2016); Bokaie, Mehdi, Assessment of Urban Heat Island based on the relationship between land surface temperature and Land Use/ Land Cover in Tehran, Sustainable Cities and Society, 23, pp. 94-104, (2016); El-Hattab, Mamdouh M., Monitoring and assessment of urban heat islands over the Southern region of Cairo Governorate, Egypt, Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Science, 21, 3, pp. 311-323, (2018); Kafy, Abdulla Al, Predicting the impacts of land use/land cover changes on seasonal urban thermal characteristics using machine learning algorithms, Building and Environment, 217, (2022); Najafzadeh, Faezeh, Spatial and temporal analysis of surface urban heat island and thermal comfort using landsat satellite images between 1989 and 2019: A case study in tehran, Remote Sensing, 13, 21, (2021); Vapnik, Vladimir N., On the uniform convergence of relative frequencies of events to their probabilities, pp. 11-30, (2015)","S.

Food-related urbanism has been investigated for decades to explore how food access influences placemaking and urban forms. With global climate change, foodscapes within urban spaces are an important consideration in urban design and planning for food security and community health. The distribution of catering businesses (restaurants and cafés), one critical method of access to food, is highly associated with urban spaces because of their high impact on diet patterns, human physical activities, travel behaviors, and the use of public spaces. This research explores the spatial associations that exist between the distribution of catering businesses and the design and planning of urban spaces in London. This quantitative research includes three parts: (1) uses Open Street Map data and the GIS spatial analysis method to study the distribution of catering businesses; (2) uses the imagery segmentation method in machine learning to categorize urban spaces into open, landscape, and conflict spaces; and (3) establishes the association between the distribution of catering businesses and the categories of urban spaces through Spearman’s correlation and a linear regression model. The results indicate that the spatial distributions of catering businesses are highly correlated with urban spaces. Conflict and landscape spaces have a significant positive influence on the distribution of catering businesses, while open space has a significant negative influence. Based on the context of global climate change, this research contributes a quantitative urban design and planning approach to promote access to food increase food options and advocate active lifestyles. © 2022 by the authors.",computer vision; data-driven; food access; regression model; urban space,Climate change; Food supply; Image segmentation; Linear regression; Urban planning; Data driven; Data segmentation; Design and planning; Food access; Global climate changes; Images segmentations; Regression modelling; Spatial associations; Urban design; Urban spaces; Computer vision; accessibility; business; computer vision; food industry; GIS; image analysis; Internet; regression analysis; segmentation; spatial distribution; urban planning; England; London [England]; United Kingdom,,,,,,,"Pielke, Roger A., A new paradigm for assessing the role of agriculture in the climate system and in climate change, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 142, 2-4, pp. 234-254, (2007); Parham, Susan, Exploring food and urbanism, Journal of Urbanism, 13, 1, pp. 1-12, (2020); Moragues-Faus, Ana M., Reframing the foodscape: the emergent world of urban food policy, Environment and Planning A, 47, 7, pp. 1558-1573, (2015); Hanser, Amy, Good Food in the City: How Cultural Ideas About Food Shape Street Vending Regulation, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 45, 3, pp. 519-534, (2021); International Journal of Architecture and Urban Development, (2013); Frank, Lawrence Douglas, Comparing walkability methods: Creation of street smart walk score and efficacy of a code-based 3D walkability index, Journal of Transport and Health, 21, (2021); Ewing, Reid H., Measuring the unmeasurable: Urban design qualities related to walkability, Journal of Urban Design, 14, 1, pp. 65-84, (2009); London Food Strategy Healthy and Sustainable Food for London, (2018); A Crisis within A Crisis the Impact of Covid 19 on Household Food Security, (2021); Liu, Kang, Visualizing and exploring POI configurations of urban regions on POI-type semantic space, Cities, 99, (2020)","M.

We present a new technique for probabilistic precipitation nowcasting by generating an ensemble of equiprobable forecasts, which is especially useful for weather radars with limited spatial range, and that can be used operationally on devices with low computational capacity. The ensemble members are obtained by a novel stochastic noise generation process, consistent with the spatial scales not resolved by the prediction model, which allows continuous downscaling of the output of a deep generative neural network. Through an in-depth analysis of the results, for precipitation accumulated in the first hour, measured by all the most robust skill indicators, extended to an entire year of data at 5-min time resolution, we demonstrate that the proposed procedure is able to provide calibrated, reliable, and sharp ensemble rainfall forecasts with a quality comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art classical alternative optical flow technique. The ensemble generation procedure we propose is sufficiently general to be applied in principle to other deterministic architectures as well, thus enabling their generalization in probabilistic terms. © 2022 by the authors.",deep learning; generative neural network; meteorological radar data; optical flow; probabilistic nowcast; spatial downscaling,,,,,,Regione Autonoma della Sardegna,"This research was funded by the Tessuto Digitale Metropolitano (TDM) project with funds provided by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, through Action 1.2.2 of the POR FESR Sardinia 2014–2020.","Bulletin, (2019); Ayzel, Georgy V., Optical flow models as an open benchmark for radar-based precipitation nowcasting (rainymotion v0.1), Geoscientific Model Development, 12, 4, pp. 1387-1402, (2019); Dixon, Michael J., TITAN: thunderstorm identification, tracking, analysis, and nowcasting - a radar-based methodology, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 10, 6, pp. 785-797, (1993); Chang, Paoliang, An operational multi-radar multi-sensor QPE system in Taiwan, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 102, 3, pp. 555-577, (2021); Smith, K.

However, identifying the relationships between water quality and spatially and temporally varying environmental variables with a machine learning technique in a heterogeneous urban landscape has been understudied. We explore how seasonal and variable precipitation amounts and other small-scale landscape variables affect E. coli, total suspended solids (TSS), nitrogen-nitrate, orthophosphate, lead, and zinc concentrations in Portland, Oregon, USA. Mann–Whitney tests were used to detect differences in water quality between seasons and COVID-19 periods. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was used to identify the relationship between water quality and explanatory variables. A Random Forest (RF) model was used to predict water quality using antecedent precipitation amounts and landscape variables as inputs. The performance of RF was compared with that of ordinary least squares (OLS). Mann–Whitney tests identified statistically significant differences in all pollutant concentrations (except TSS) between the wet and dry seasons. Nitrate was the only pollutant to display statistically significant reductions in median concentrations (from 1.5 mg/L to 1.04 mg/L) during the COVID-19 lockdown period, likely associated with reduced traffic volumes. Spearman’s correlation analysis identified the highest correlation coefficients between one-day precipitation amounts and E. coli, lead, zinc, and TSS concentrations. Road length is positively associated with E. coli and zinc. The Random Forest (RF) model best predicts orthophosphate concentrations (R2 = 0.58), followed by TSS (R2 = 0.54) and nitrate (R2 = 0.46). E. coli was the most difficult to model and had the highest RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values. Overall, the Random Forest model outperformed OLS, as evaluated by RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2. The Random Forest was an effective approach to modeling pollutant concentrations using both categorical seasonal and COVID data along with continuous rain and landscape variables to predict water quality in urban streams. Implementing optimization techniques can further improve the model’s performance and allow researchers to use a machine learning approach for water quality modeling. © 2022 by the authors.",antecedent precipitation; machine learning model; temporal analysis; urban runoff; urban runoff–management; water quality,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1758006)","Funding text 1: The authors appreciate the National Science Foundation for supporting this research.

This paper takes a typical mixed-use developed city, Adelaide, as an example and demonstrates a complete workflow (data collection, data pairing, model training, model interpretation, and model application) using machine learning algorithms to better understand the relationships between urban morphology and solar potential at an urban neighborhood (meso-level) scale. The artificial neural network model has the highest accuracy, and six urban morphology indicators (building density, plot ration, building height, building floors, variance of height, and variance of volume) are shown to be influential in predicting urban solar potential. The model also reflects the interaction between urban morphological indicators and their nonlinear impact. Futhermore, five typical morphological prototypes are identified. The average solar potential of Cluster 1 is 1402.53 kWh/m2/year, 4.3% higher than Cluster 3, 11.2% higher than Cluster 4, 21.2% higher than Cluster 2, and 36.8% higher than Cluster 5.

However, a majority of recommendations summarized by scholars for promoting TODs through urban design have failed to promote the progress of the urban design. The main reason for this issue is the long-standing tradition of design decision-making based on designers’ experience and the lack of quantitative assessment feedback on design schemes. With the development of big data and artificial intelligence, optimisation-based generative design has been explored to overcome the limitations of experience-based urban design approaches. However, the techniques and workflows are still not mature enough for designers to adopt. In response to these challenges, this study proposes a framework that integrates the generative design method and data-driven decision-making approach for urban design solutions that better implement the basic principles of TODs. Based on the urban design intelligence for TODs, this framework uses parametric tools and models to evaluate the generative urban design proposals, providing timely feedback to support the design decisions. The framework is applied to a case study to examine the feasibility. It is demonstrated that this approach succeeds in selecting optimal TOD design solutions. The role of designers’ decision-making in generative urban design, as well as the importance of quantitative and qualitative assessment in experience-based decision-making, are highlighted. © 2022 by the authors.",activity-based model; amenity accessibility; evidence-based design decision-making; generative urban design; transit-oriented development; walkability,,,,,,"(KM202210009008); Australian Research Council, ARC, (LP190100089); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52208039); North China University of Technology, NCUT; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFF0304900)","This project is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [52208039], the National key R&D program “Science and Technology Winter Olympics” key project “Evacuation system and support technology for assisting physically challenged communities” [2020YFF0304900], the Beijing High-level Overseas Talents Support Funding, R&D Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (KM202210009008), the NCUT Young Scholar Development Project, and the Australian Research Council Linkage Project [LP190100089].","Transit Oriented Development, (2020); Ibraeva, Anna, Transit-oriented development: A review of research achievements and challenges, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 132, pp. 110-130, (2020); Cervero, Robert B., Travel choices in pedestrian versus automobile oriented neighborhoods, Transport Policy, 3, 3, pp. 127-141, (1996); Currie, Graham, Investigating links between social capital and public transport, Transport Reviews, 28, 4, pp. 529-547, (2008); Kamruzzaman, Liton (Md), Patterns of social capital associated with transit oriented development, Journal of Transport Geography, 35, pp. 144-155, (2014); Regional City Planning for the End of Sprawl, (2001); Transforming Cities with Transit Transit and Land Use Integration for Sustainable Urban Development, (2013); Journal of Transport and Land Use, (2008); Good City Form, (1981); New Transit Town Best Practices in Transit Oriented Development, (2004)","X.

However, LCZ entities are very difficult to be identified by pixel-based classifiers or object-oriented image analysis, as they are often a complicated combination of multiple ground objects (e.g., buildings, roads, grassland, etc.). Scene classifiers, especially deep learning methods can exploit the structure or contextual information of image scenes and then improve the performance of LCZ classification. However, the square and uniform-sized image patches often bring about extra challenges, as they cannot exactly match LCZ entities of diverse sizes and shapes in most cases. In this study, a sequential virtual scene method is presented to identify LCZ entities of diverse shapes and sizes, which consists of a small “core patch” for scanning diverse entities and sequential virtual scenes for providing abundant context. Specifically, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) were used to learn the spatial relationship among virtual scenes, respectively. Importantly, a “self-attention” mechanism is designed to weigh the contribution of every virtual scene for alleviating the influences of mixed patches, according to the similarity between its hidden state and the final hidden state. Experiments prove SVS achieves better accuracies than random forest and ResNet and has the outstanding capacity of identifying irregular LCZ entities. It is a promising way to carry out LCZ mapping in cities of different types due to its flexibility and adaptability. © 2022 by the authors.",climate change; CNN; remote sensing; scene classification; urban environment,Classification (of information); Climate change; Decision trees; E-learning; Image classification; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Mapping; Remote sensing; Hidden state; Local climate; Multiple grounds; Object-oriented image analysis; Remote-sensing; Scene classification; Thermal environment; Urban environments; Urban landscape; Virtual scenes; Long short-term memory,,,,,"(KF- 2020-05-007); (YNLH202011010793/A); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41772352, BNORSG-202104); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Guangxi Key Research and Development Program, (2021BID009); Guangxi Key Research and Development Program; (202235)","This study was sponsored by the Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Natural Resources(KF- 2020-05-007), the science and technology innovation project of Yunnan Bureau of Geology and Minerals Exploration and Development (No. 202235), the key research and development program of Hubei province (No. 2021BID009), the fine investigation and risk assessment of geological hazards in critical regions of Yunnan Province of 2020 (No. YNLH202011010793/A), the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41772352), the Open Fund of Badong National Observation and Research Station of Geohazards (No. BNORSG-202104).","Yoo, Cheolhee, Comparison between convolutional neural networks and random forest for local climate zone classification in mega urban areas using Landsat images, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 157, pp. 155-170, (2019); Liu, Shengjie Kris, Local climate zone mapping as remote sensing scene classification using deep learning: A case study of metropolitan China, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 164, pp. 229-242, (2020); Cai, Meng, Investigating the relationship between local climate zone and land surface temperature using an improved WUDAPT methodology – A case study of Yangtze River Delta, China, Urban Climate, 24, pp. 485-502, (2018); Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report, (2014); Bechtel, Benjamin, Classification of local climate zones based on multiple earth observation data, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 5, 4, pp. 1191-1202, (2012); Coseo, Paul J., How factors of land use/land cover, building configuration, and adjacent heat sources and sinks explain Urban Heat Islands in Chicago, Landscape and Urban Planning, 125, pp. 117-129, (2014); Tuia, Devis, 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest: Open Data for Global Multimodal Land Use Classification [Technical Committees], IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine, 5, 1, pp. 70-73, (2017); Guo, Guanhua, Impacts of urban biophysical composition on land surface temperature in urban heat island clusters, Landscape and Urban Planning, 135, pp. 1-10, (2015); Fu, Cheng, Integrating activity-based geographic information and long-term remote sensing to characterize urban land use change, Remote Sensing, 11, 24, (2019); Stewart, Iain D., Local climate zones for urban temperature studies, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 93, 12, pp. 1879-1900, (2012)","C.

In addition, available public participation computational tools focus mainly on information and idea sharing, leaving the public excluded in design generation because of their lack of design expertise. To address such an issue, this study develops Urban-GAN, a plural urban design computation system, to provide new technical support for design empowerment, allowing the public to generate their own designs. The sub-symbolic representation and artificial intelligence techniques of deep convolutional neural networks, case-based reasoning, and generative adversarial networks are used to acquire and embody design knowledge as the density function, and generate design schemes with this knowledge. The system consists of an urban form database and five process models through which the user with little design expertise can select urban form cases, generate designs similar to those cases, and make design decisions. The Urban-GAN is applied to hypothetical design experiments, which show that the user is able to apply the system to successfully generate distinctive designs following the urban form “styles” in Manhattan, Portland, and Shanghai. This study further extends the discussion about the plural urban design computation to general reflections on the goals and values in AI technique application in planning and design. © The Author(s) 2022.",case-based reasoning; deep learning; design empowerment; generative adversarial networks; perceptive performance; urban form style,artificial intelligence; computer aided design; empowerment; perception; performance assessment; urban design,,,,,"Canadian Political Science Association, ACSP; Seoul National University, SNU; Ministry of Education, MOE, (5120200113713); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2018R1C1B5043758); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is supported by the Creative-Pioneering Researchers Program through Seoul National University (SNU), the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT) (No. 2018R1C1B5043758), and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Education) (No. 5120200113713).

While previous research has identified that the composition of urban landscapes influences the physical properties of the environment such as surface temperature, a generalizable and flexible framework is needed that can be used to compare cities across time and space. This study employs the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) classification combined with remote sensing of New York City’s land surface temperature (LST). These are then linked using machine learning and statistical modeling to identify how greenspace and the built environment influence urban surface temperature. Further, changes in urban structure are then connected to changes in LST over time. It was observed that areas with urban units composed of largely the built environment hosted the hottest temperatures while those with vegetation and water were coolest. Likewise, this is reinforced by borough-level spatial differences in both urban structure and heat. Comparison of these relationships over the period between 2008 and 2017 identified changes in surface temperature that are likely due to the changes in the presence of water, low-rise buildings, and pavement across the city. This research reinforces how human alteration of the environment changes LST and offers units of analysis that can be used for research and urban planning. © The Author(s) 2022.",new york city; spatial-temporal change; Structure of urban landscapes; surface temperature; urban structure,greenspace; spatiotemporal analysis; surface temperature; urban area; urban design; urban development; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1832407)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project is funded by NSF award # 1832407.","Albright, Thomas P., Heat waves measured with MODIS land surface temperature data predict changes in avian community structure, Remote Sensing of Environment, 115, 1, pp. 245-254, (2011); Azhdari, Abolghasem, Urban morphology and landscape structure effect on land surface temperature: Evidence from Shiraz, a semi-arid city, Sustainable Cities and Society, 41, pp. 853-864, (2018); Bechtel, Benjamin, Multitemporal Landsat data for urban heat island assessment and classification of local climate zones, pp. 129-132, (2011); Bokaie, Mehdi, Assessment of Urban Heat Island based on the relationship between land surface temperature and Land Use/ Land Cover in Tehran, Sustainable Cities and Society, 23, pp. 94-104, (2016); Buyantuyev, Alexander B., Urban heat islands and landscape heterogeneity: Linking spatiotemporal variations in surface temperatures to land-cover and socioeconomic patterns, Landscape Ecology, 25, 1, pp. 17-33, (2010); Chen, Wei, A comparative study of logistic model tree, random forest, and classification and regression tree models for spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility, Catena, 151, pp. 147-160, (2017); Chen, Xu, Impacts of urban surface characteristics on spatiotemporal pattern of land surface temperature in Kunming of China, Sustainable Cities and Society, 32, pp. 87-99, (2017); Chen, Yunhao, Evaluating the impact of the building density and height on the block surface temperature, Building and Environment, 168, (2020); Casellas Connors, John Patrick, Landscape configuration and urban heat island effects: Assessing the relationship between landscape characteristics and land surface temperature in Phoenix, Arizona, Landscape Ecology, 28, 2, pp. 271-283, (2013); Cummings, Lucas E., Predicting citywide distribution of air pollution using mobile monitoring and three-dimensional urban structure, Sustainable Cities and Society, 76, (2022)",,,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,,,23998083; 23998091,,,,English,Environ.

There have been significant research contributions in recent decades to understanding factors that can influence the likelihood of citizens choosing active travel modes, with great advances in understanding the built environment, particularly macro-scaled urban factors such as land-use mix, population density, and street patterns. So why are people still not walking? And is there anything we can do to try to change this? To answer these questions, this paper explores walking environment assessment approaches using a trans-disciplinary narrative approach, touching on multiple critical disciplinary knowledge areas. We find that while much of the research into the built environment's influence on walking has made positive contributions in helping identify areas of cities that discourage active travel, the capacity to improve these areas has been limited. While macro-scaled factors commonly considered in 'walkability' analysis are highly influential to mode choice, unless working on green-field development, these factors may require re-zoning private land, substantial demolition and renewal, and may be financially or politically infeasible and thus extremely difficult to change. There is a need to augment macro-scaled analysis with micro-scaled tools, and to establish multi-criterion spatio-temporal design decision support approaches drawing from emerging technologies to make informed, integrated and effective urban design changes. These methods applied at precinct and streetscape levels have the potential to make feasible improvements to the 'walk-quality' of the built environment and contribute to facilitating active travel. © Author(s) 2022.","Digital evaluation and design; Multi-criteria; Pedestrian environment; Spatio-temporal analysis, ABM, Machine learning, Computer vision; Walk-quality, Walkability","Decision support systems; Design; E-learning; Land use; Machine learning; Population statistics; Quality control; Built environment; Digital evaluation and design; Machine-learning; Multi-criteria; Multi-Criterion; Pedestrian environment; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal analyse, ABM, machine learning, computer vision; Spatiotemporal analysis; Walk-quality, walkability; Computer vision",,,,,"New Hampshire Department of Transportation, NHDOT; Australian Research Council, ARC, (LP190100089); Transport Accident Commission, TAC; University of Melbourne, UNIMELB; Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, (KM202210009008)","This research is funded by the Australian Research Councils, Linkage Project: Walk-quality: A multi-criteria design platform to facilitate active travel, (LP190100089) and partners: TAC, Department of Transport, City of Glen Eira, City of Maribyrnong, and movendo; The University of Melbourne ECR grant project ‘Getting to yes for nature-based solutions using immersive virtual environments’; The Beijing High-level Overseas Talents Support Funding; and The R&D Programme of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (KM202210009008).","Causes of Death Australia 2008, (2010); Adamson, Lyn, There's more to life than just walking"": Older women's ways of staying healthy and happy, Journal of Aging and Physical Activity, 14, 4, pp. 380-391, (2006); Proceedings of the Esri Users Group Conference, (2009); Health and Place an Analysis of the Built Environment S Impact on Walking Behavior and Health, (2014); Investment to Strengthen Sport Across Australia Text, (2021); Badland, Hannah M., Using simple agent-based modeling to inform and enhance neighborhood walkability, International Journal of Health Geographics, 12, (2013); Batty, Michael J., Classifying urban models, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 43, 2, pp. 251-256, (2016); Berry, Rowan, Tree canopy shade impacts on solar irradiance received by building walls and their surface temperature, Building and Environment, 69, pp. 91-100, (2013); Buys, Laurie R., Conceptualising convenience: Transportation practices and perceptions of inner-urban high density residents in Brisbane, Australia, Transport Policy, 18, 1, pp. 289-297, (2011); Cerin, Ester, Explaining socio-economic status differences in walking for transport: An ecological analysis of individual, social and environmental factors, Social Science and Medicine, 68, 6, pp. 1013-1020, (2009)","M.

In addition, deep learning techniques in the visual field provide analysis methods for image classification, processing, and segmentation. This study reviewed the applicability of gaze movement and deep learning-based satisfaction evaluation on the landscape using an immersive virtual reality-based eye-tracking device. To this end, the following research procedures were established and analysed. First, the gaze movement of the test taker is measured using an immersive virtual environment-based eye tracker. The relationship between the gaze movement pattern of the test taker and the satisfaction evaluation result for the landscape image is analysed. Second, using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based Class Activation Map (CAM) technique, a model for estimating the satisfaction evaluation result is constructed, and the gaze pattern of the test taker is derived. Third, we compare and analyse the similarity between the gaze heat map derived through the immersive virtual environment-based gaze tracker and the heat map generated by CAM. This study suggests the applicability of urban environment technology and deep learning methods to understand landscape planning factors that affect urban landscape satisfaction, resulting from the three-dimensional and immediate visual cognitive activity. © © 2022 J.

These decisions require consideration of complex interdependent existing and proposed infrastructure and must be informed by data and modelling from multiple disciplines such as hydrologists transport engineers and urban planners. Here we describe the challenges of integrating these data and modelling from both GIS and BIM sources into a framework that could support flood moderation decision-making embedded within a spatially enabled Digital Twin. Our findings outline some of the considerable adjustments to future data collection methods that will be required to enable such a decision-support framework. Furthermore we outline the requirements of the framework for employability in stakeholders and community decision-making forums. We test this framework on a large-scale urban renewal precinct in Melbourne Australia with well recognised current and future flooding issues. © © 2022 N.

Planning the best path of urban greenery is a means to effectively maximize the use of urban greenery, which plays a positive role in the physical and mental health of urban residents and the path planning of visitors. In this paper, we used Google street view to obtain street view images of Osaka City. The semantic segmentation model is adopted to segment the street view images and analyze the green view index (GVI) of Osaka City. Based on the GVI, we take advantage of the adjacency matrix and Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate GVI best path, solving the limitations of ArcGIS software. Our analysis not only allows the calculation of specific routes for the GVI best paths but also realizes the visualization and integration of neighborhood urban greenery. By summarizing all the data, we can conduct an intuitive feeling and objective analysis of the street-level greenery in the research area. Based on this, such as urban residents and visitors can maximize the available natural resources for a better life.

However, most empirical studies fail to consider emotion-oriented landscape assessments under dynamic perspectives despite the fact that individually observed sceneries alter with angle. To close this gap, a real-time sentimental-based landscape assessment framework is developed, integrating facial expression recognition with semantic segmentation of changing landscapes. Furthermore, a case study using panoramic videos converted from Google Street View images to simulate changing scenes was used to test the viability of this framework, resulting in five million big data points. The result of this study shows that through the collaboration of deep learning algorithms, finer visual variables were classified, subtle emotional responses were tracked, and better regression results for valence and arousal were obtained. Among all the predictors, the proportion of grass was the most significant predictor for emotional perception. The proposed framework is adaptable and human-centric, and it enables the instantaneous emotional perception of the built environment by the general public as a feedback survey tool to aid urban planners in creating UGS that promote emotional well-being. © 2022 by the authors.",deep learning; facial expression recognition; landscape assessment; semantic segmentation; urban green space,greenspace; health impact; machine learning; perception; public attitude; urban design; algorithm; arousal; article; big data; built environment; deep learning; emotion; emotional stability; emotional well-being; facial recognition; grass; human; human experiment; nonhuman; videorecording; physiology; semantics; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Emotions; Facial Recognition; Humans; Semantics,,,,,,,"Benzell, Seth G., Rationing social contact during the COVID-19 pandemic: Transmission risk and social benefits of US locations, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117, 26, pp. 14642-14644, (2020); Tobías, Aurelio, Evaluation of the lockdowns for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy and Spain after one month follow up, Science of the Total Environment, 725, (2020); Leigh-Hunt, Nicholas, An overview of systematic reviews on the public health consequences of social isolation and loneliness, Public Health, 152, pp. 157-171, (2017); Smith, Kimberley J., Typologies of loneliness, living alone and social isolation, and their associations with physical and mental health, Ageing and Society, 39, 8, pp. 1709-1730, (2019); Gascon, Mireia, Outdoor blue spaces, human health and well-being: A systematic review of quantitative studies, International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health, 220, 8, pp. 1207-1221, (2017); Kondo, Michelle C., Urban green space and its impact on human health, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 3, (2018); Meuwese, Daphne, Beating the blues by viewing Green: Depressive symptoms predict greater restoration from stress and negative affect after viewing a nature video, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 75, (2021); Pouso, Sarai, Contact with blue-green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown beneficial for mental health, Science of the Total Environment, 756, (2021); Yang, Ying, Viewing nature scenes reduces the pain of social ostracism, Journal of Social Psychology, pp. 1-19, (2020); Nordh, Helena, Tracking Restorative Components: Patterns in Eye Movements as a Consequence of a Restorative Rating Task, Landscape Research, 38, 1, pp. 101-116, (2013)","Y.

The rise of social media data and breakthroughs in deep learning frameworks for computer vision provide new opportunities for studying public perceptions in public spaces. While social media research methods already exist for extracting geo-information on public preferences and emotion analysis findings from geodata, this paper aims at deep learning analysis by building a VGG-16 image classification method that enhanced the research content of images without geo-information. In this study, 1940 Flickr images of the Haihe River in Tianjin were identified in multiple scenes with deep learning. The regularized VGG-16 architecture showed high accuracies of 81.75% for the TOP-1 and 96.75% for the TOP-5 and Grad-CAM visualization modules for the interpretation of classification results. The result of the present work indicate that images of the Haihe River are dominated by skyscrapers, bridges, promenades, and urban canals. After using kernel density to visualize the spatial distribution of Flickr images with geodata, it was found that there are three vitality areas in Haihe River. However, the kernel density result also shows that judging spatial visualization based solely on geodata is incomplete. The spatial distribution can be used as an assistant function in the case of the under-representation of geodata. Collectively, the field of how to apply computer vision to urban design research was explored and extended in this trial study. © 2022 by the authors.",deep learning; Flickr; image classification; social media data; urban public space,,,,,,"China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106250093); China Scholarship Council, CSC",The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the China Scholarship Council (CSC) (Project NO.202106250093).,"Xu, Hui, Key indicators for the resilience of complex urban public spaces, Journal of Building Engineering, 12, pp. 306-313, (2017); Loughran, Kevin, Urban parks and urban problems: An historical perspective on green space development as a cultural fix, Urban Studies, 57, 11, pp. 2321-2338, (2020); Leclercq, Els M., Is public space privatization always bad for the public?

Urban parks generally may enhance people's positive sentiments, but little is known about explicitly linking the landscape composition and configuration of urban parks directly with visitors' sentiments based on social media data. The main objective of this study, therefore, was to identify key landscape attributes that influence this relationship in the Beijing metropolitan region. We first crawled 55,441 valid text data items from Sina Weibo for 99 urban parks within the fifth ring road of Beijing. Then, we quantified the positive emotions of visitors to urban parks using social media data and sentiment analysis. Finally, we evaluated the differences in visitors' positive emotions among different types of parks and used Random Forest to identify urban park attributes that were correlated with positive emotions. We found that visitors to different types of urban parks had different levels of positive emotions. Specifically, visitors to comprehensive parks and cultural relics parks were significantly happier than visitors to community parks. Visitors to parks between the third and fourth ring roads in Beijing had the lowest levels of positive emotions. Positive emotions were found to be positively correlated with park size and the mean size of water bodies but negatively correlated with large areas of impervious surfaces. This study sheds new light on the relationship between park landscape patterns and visitors' positive emotions through a new approach based on social media data. The research methods and findings may inspire similar studies in other cities and countries, which are needed to improve park planning and management and thus enhance urban sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Big data; Cultural services; Deep learning; Ecosystem services; Green and blue spaces; Human well-being; Urban landscape sustainability,social media; Beijing [China]; China,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41871185, 41971271); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2014CB954303, 2019YFA0607203); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFA0607203), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41871185&41971271), and the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954303).","Ambrose, Graham, Is gardening associated with greater happiness of urban residents?

However, there is uncertainty about which urban heat mitigation strategies (UHMSs) can provide better solutions for a specific urban context. There is a compelling need for local governments to automate the decision-making process and optimise the combination of UHMSs to maximise the mitigation outcomes for their cities. We develop a novel decision-making framework that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into urban heat mitigation in the built environment to enable an automated process of decision making. The novel decision-making framework comprises: the ontology-based knowledge representation of UHMSs and their relationships with urban contexts and performance assessment to share knowledge in urban heat mitigation domain; sensitivity analysis of the environmental, social and economic performance of UHMSs to get key variables for UHMSs; and genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimisation of UHMSs. The novel decision-making framework enables generating the context-based optimised UHMS combinations to support local governments’ decision-making. The research outcomes will advance interdisciplinary knowledge about using AI techniques in the decision-making process for urban heat mitigation. © 2022","Multi-objective optimisation; Sensitive planning and design variables; Urban contexts, Ontology; Urban heat mitigation strategies","Automation; Behavioral research; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Sensitivity analysis; Context ontology; Decision-making frameworks; Design variables; Mitigation strategy; Multi-objectives optimization; Planning and design; Sensitive planning and design variable; Urban context; Urban context, ontology; Urban heat mitigation strategy; Multiobjective optimization; artificial intelligence; decision making; genetic algorithm; knowledge; local government; optimization; planning process; urban design; urban planning; article; built environment; government; heat; human; multiobjective optimization; ontology; sensitivity analysis",,,,,,,"Alexandri, Eleftheria, Temperature decreases in an urban canyon due to green walls and green roofs in diverse climates, Building and Environment, 43, 4, pp. 480-493, (2008); undefined, (2018); PLEA 2013 29th Conference Sustainable Architecture for A Renewable Future Munich Germany, (2013); Chow, Winston T.L., Observing and modeling the nocturnal park cool island of an arid city: Horizontal and vertical impacts, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 103, 1, pp. 197-211, (2011); de Freitas, Christopher R., A comparison and appraisal of a comprehensive range of human thermal climate indices, International Journal of Biometeorology, 61, 3, pp. 487-512, (2017); undefined, (2019); undefined, (2019); Ene, Seval, A genetic algorithm for minimizing energy consumption in warehouses, Energy, 114, pp. 973-980, (2016); Field, Christopher B., Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation: Special report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, 9781107025066, pp. 1-582, (2012); Multiobjective Genetic Algorithms with Application to Control Engineering Problems, (1995)","J.

We proposed a new UE model by integrating a convolutional neural network (i.e., U-Net) and a recurrent neural network (i.e., long short-term memory, LSTM), and applied it in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTHUA). The results yielded a high overall accuracy (99.18 %), a Kappa coefficient of 0.88 and a figure of merit of 0.13, which are greater than those of existing models. Such improvements are attributed to the multiscale neighborhood information powered by U-Net and the time series information of historical urban expansion uncovered by LSTM. The urban land in the BTHUA is projected to peak at 8736–9155 km2 during the period 2039–2043, which is an increase in the range of 10.99–16.31 % compared with that in 2020.

Yet, conventional studies on human perception of urban landscape are largely dependent on individual experience, which may restrict the co-production of knowledge that can be operationalized across spatial scales and sectors. In this study, we mapped human perception of urban landscape in Shanghai by leveraging an advanced deep-learning approach and street-view images. Specifically, the ResNet50 model was employed to map four critical perceptions, i.e., security, depression, vitality, and aesthetic, at parcel level. We further explored the relationship between human perception and land-use types. Our results show that highly urbanized area (Puxi district encompassed by the Inner Ring Road) is perceived as more secure and vital, but more depressing. Besides, human perception varies substantially across different land-use types, among which administrative and service land is favored with regard to all the four perception types. This study advances our understanding of urban landscape through the lens of human perception, and provides nuanced insights into steering human settlement towards sustainability by strategically promoting mixed land use. © 2022 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Human perception; Land use; Street-view image; Urban landscape,esthetics; GIS; human settlement; image analysis; land use; landscape structure; machine learning; mapping method; perception; sustainability; urban area; China; Shanghai,,,,,"National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (21ZDA064); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","This work was supported by the Major Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21ZDA064).

Although characterizing landscape to protect landscape diversity is widely used in regional landscape and preservation practices, it is difficult to apply to urban landscape character assessment, which needs fine-scale data support, explicit study units, and effective clustering models. Therefore, this study uses urban big geospatial data and machine learning technology to establish a technical system for character assessment of urban landscape applicable to the block scale and complete the landscape assessment of urban areas of Beijing and Shanghai, China. A total of 64 landscape character types were identified in Beijing, and 61 in Shanghai. We find that (1) urban landscape characters are different with the ring road as the boundary, but each zone presents a combination of different proportions of landscape characters. (2) Beijing's city wall demolition policy is affected by historical protection policy. Landscape differentiation on both sides of the Huangpu River in Shanghai has yet to be realized. This study extends the theory of LCA and realizes the research exploration of urban built environment. It can also be used to guide urban zoning control, evaluate planning policy, and provide assistance in practice for sustainable urban development and management. © 2022",Landscape character; Landscape classification; Sustainability; Unsupervised learning; Urban big data; Urban landscape,Big data; Planning; Unsupervised learning; Urban growth; Driving forces; Fine-scale; Landscape characters; Landscape classification; Landscape diversity; Machine-learning; Regional landscapes; Urban big data; Urban landscape; Urban sustainable development; Sustainable development; data set; land classification; machine learning; planning practice; spatial data; sustainable development; urban development; urban planning; zoning policy; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Shanghai,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51908488); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY22E080013); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; China Academy of Space Technology, CAST, (2021QNRC001); China Academy of Space Technology, CAST","This work was supported by National Science Foundation of China (NO. 51908488), the Natural Science Fund of Zhejiang Province (LY22E080013), and Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (2021QNRC001).","Agnoletti, Mauro, Rural landscape, nature conservation and culture: Some notes on research trends and management approaches from a (southern) European perspective, Landscape and Urban Planning, 126, pp. 66-73, (2014); Landscape Perspectives the Holistic Nature of Landscape, (2017); Atik, Meryem, Exploring a combination of objective and subjective assessment in landscape classification: Side case from Turkey, Applied Geography, 83, pp. 130-140, (2017); Bandarin, Francesco, The Historic Urban Landscape: Managing Heritage in an Urban Century, (2012); Bastian, Olaf, Landscape classification in Saxony (Germany) - A tool for holistic regional planning, Landscape and Urban Planning, 50, 1-3, pp. 145-155, (2000); Bauer, Eric, Empirical comparison of voting classification algorithms: bagging, boosting, and variants, Machine Learning, 36, 1, pp. 105-139, (1999); Bibri, Simon Elias, The core enabling technologies of big data analytics and context-aware computing for smart sustainable cities: a review and synthesis, Journal of Big Data, 4, 1, (2017); Castillo-rodrÃ­guez, Miguel, A geomorphologic GIS-multivariate analysis approach to delineate environmental units, a case study of La Malinche volcano (central México), Applied Geography, 30, 4, pp. 629-638, (2010); Cataldi, Giancarlo, Saverio Muratori and the Italian school of planning typology, Urban Morphology, 6, 1, pp. 3-14, (2002); Chuman, Tomáš, Multivariate classification analysis of cultural landscapes: An example from the Czech Republic, Landscape and Urban Planning, 98, 3-4, pp. 200-209, (2010)","J.

Today, on the one hand, with the development of remote sensing sciences, the use of aerial and satellite images has expanded, and on the other hand, new advances in the processing of these images have led to improved analysis results on remote sensing images. One of the most up-to-date branches of image processing is deep learning networks, which have wide applications in various fields of engineering sciences, including remote sensing sciences. In this study, to extract the roads, the deep learning method with the customized U-Net architecture was used on the dataset of Massachusetts, USA, which were published in free access. Many studies have been done on this data, which generally emphasizes the architecture and methods of post-processing. In this research, focusing on data, deep learning networks have been used in two different scenarios. Scenario 1 of RGB images and Scenario 2, an additional channel with a random forest road/on-road classified image, is added to the RGB images and trained by the network. The results of the U-Net network training indicate very high accuracy of the F1-score average of 0.92 for Scenario 2. The method in this article can be used as a reliable method in road detection. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",Deep learning; Massachusetts dataset; Road detection; U-Net,algorithm; data set; remote sensing; road; satellite imagery; Massachusetts; United States,,,,,,,"Abdollahi, Arnick, Deep learning approaches applied to remote sensing datasets for road extraction: A state-of-the-art review, Remote Sensing, 12, 9, (2020); Alshaikhli, Tamara, Automated method of road extraction from aerial images using a deep convolutional neural network, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 9, 22, (2019); Alshehhi, Rasha, Simultaneous extraction of roads and buildings in remote sensing imagery with convolutional neural networks, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 130, pp. 139-149, (2017); Automatic Road Extraction from Multispectral High Resolution Satellite Images, (2012); Badrinarayanan, Vijay, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); Bastani, Favyen, RoadTracer: Automatic Extraction of Road Networks from Aerial Images, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4720-4728, (2018); Belgiu, Mariana, Random forest in remote sensing: A review of applications and future directions, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 114, pp. 24-31, (2016); Automatic Road Extraction from Aerial Images by Probabilistic Contour Tracking Proceedings 2003 International Conference on Image Processing, (2003); Buslaev, Alexander, Fully convolutional network for automatic road extraction from satellite imagery, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2018-June, pp. 197-200, (2018); Rethinking Atrous Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation, (2017)","R.

However, the usage and user experiences of greenways are often challenging to measure because it is costly to survey such large areas. Based on the online postings from Instagram in 2017, this paper used Computer Vision (CV) technology to analyze and compare how the general public uses two typical greenway parks, The High Line in New York City and the Atlanta Beltline in Atlanta. Face and object detection analysis were conducted to infer user composition, activities, and key experiences. We presented the temporal patterns of Instagram postings as well as the group gatherings, smiling, and representative objects detected from photos. Our results have shown high user engagement levels for both parks while teens are significantly underrepresented. The High Line had more group activities and was more active during weekdays than the Atlanta Beltline. Stronger sense of escape and physical activities can be found in Atlanta Beltline. In summary, social media images like Instagram can provide strong empirical evidence for urban greenway usage when combined with artificial intelligence technologies, which can support the future practice of landscape architecture and urban design. © The Author(s) 2022.",computer vision; park usage; place quality; social media; Urban greenway,artificial intelligence; comparative study; computer vision; greenspace; social media; temporal variation; urban area; Atlanta; Georgia; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (OAC-2112356, SMA-2122054); National Science Foundation, NSF; Texas A and M University, TAMU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants SMA-2122054 and OAC-2112356, Texas A&M University Harold L.

Fulton Schools of Engineering, Tempe, AZ, United States","The efficacy of urban mitigation strategies for heat and carbon emissions relies heavily on local urban characteristics. The continuous development and improvement of urban land surface models enable rather accurate assessment of the environmental impact on urban development strategies, whereas physically-based simulations remain computationally costly and time consuming, as a consequence of the increasing complexity of urban system dynamics. Hence it is imperative to develop fast, efficient, and economic operational toolkits for urban planners to foster the design, implementation, and evaluation of urban mitigation strategies, while retaining the accuracy and robustness of physical models. In this study, we adopt a machine learning (ML) algorithm, viz. Gaussian Process Regression, to emulate the physics of heat and biogenic carbon exchange in the built environment. The ML surrogate is trained and validated on the simulation results generated by a state-of-the-art single-layer urban canopy model over a wide range of urban characteristics, showing high accuracy in capturing heat and carbon dynamics. Using the validated surrogate model, we then conduct multi-objective optimization using the genetic algorithm to optimize urban design scenarios for desirable urban mitigation effects. While the use of urban greenery is found effective in mitigating both urban heat and carbon emissions, there is manifest trade-offs among ameliorating diverse urban environmental indicators. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon dioxide emission; Environmental system dynamics; Machine learning; Urban heat mitigation; Urban system planning,Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Planning; System theory; Urban growth; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Environmental system dynamic; Heat emission; Mitigation strategy; Multi-objectives optimization; System planning; Urban heat mitigation; Urban system planning; Urban systems; Global warming; carbon emission; heat island; machine learning; multiobjective programming; optimization; urban design; urban planning,,,,,"(DEB-1637590); National Science Foundation, NSF, (AGS-1930629, CBET-2028868, CISE-1931297, GEO-2044051); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC20K1263); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, (NA20OAR4310341); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA","This study is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants AGS-1930629 , CBET-2028868 , GEO-2044051 , and CISE-1931297 , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under grant # 80NSSC20K1263 , and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under grant NA20OAR4310341 .

It is often regarded as an indicator of social justice. However, due to the difficulties in obtaining green space exposure data from a ground-based view, an effective evaluation of the green space exposure inequity at the community level remains challenging. In this study, we presented a green space exposure inequity assessment framework, integrating the Green View Index (GVI), deep learning, spatial statistical analysis methods, and urban rental price big data to analyze green space exposure inequity at the community level toward a “15-minute city” in Zhengzhou, China. The results showed that green space exposure inequality is evident among residential communities. The areas in the old city were with relatively high GVI and the new city districts were with relatively low GVI. Moreover, a spatially uneven association was observed between the degree of green space exposure and housing prices. Especially, the wealthier communities in the new city districts benefit from low green space, compared to disadvantaged communities in the old city. The findings provide valuable insights for policy and planning to effectively implement greening strategies and eliminate environmental inequality in urban areas. © 2022 by the authors.

Due to the limitations in available data and technologies, existing hedonic studies mainly capture accessibility to green space (i.e., proximity), and how visual contact with green space (i.e., visibility) impacts housing prices is not well understood. This paper measures the intangible concept of visual contact with green space by taking advantage of street view images and community photos based on semantic segmentation. Then, based on hedonic model theory, a set of housing price determinants is selected. Finally, we construct two models, namely, random forest regression and geographically weighted regression models, to explore the capitalization effects of visual contact with green space on housing prices in Shenzhen, China. In our study, compared with indicators such as park accessibility and greening rate, variables of green visual contact are more important for housing prices. Moreover, the effects of visual contact with green space inside and outside the community display marked spatial variations. This work is a beneficial attempt to focus on the human scale for the actual demand of urban green planning.

Water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) projects have been proposed as an alternative due to their ability to generate multiple benefits, including improving water quality, water supply, aesthetics, urban cooling, spaces for recreation, and habitat for biodiversity. However, in most cities, investment in such systems has been relatively low, in part due to the difficulty of monetizing the multifunctional benefits of WSUD projects and including them in comprehensive economic analyses. We describe the development, testing and application of INFFEWS (Investment Framework For the Economics of Water Sensitive cities), an economic decision-support system for investment in WSUD projects. INFFEWS is based on a Benefit: Cost Analysis (BCA) framework and is consistent with standard BCA. A prominent feature of the framework is its strong emphasis on quantifying the monetary-equivalent values of intangible (non-market) benefits from WSUD projects. Development of the tools and their supporting materials has involved extensive consultation with intended users, review of existing tools, and primary research over eight years (2013–2020).

However, due to the limitation of precision of equipment, there are big gaps to collect high-resolution DEM data. A practical idea is to recover high-resolution DEMs from easily obtained low-resolution DEMs, and this process is termed DEM super-resolution (SR). However, traditional DEM SR methods (e.g., bicubic interpolation) tend to over-smooth high-frequency regions on account of the operation of averaging local variations. With the recent development of machine learning, image SR methods have made great progress. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of terrain characters (e.g., peak and valley) and the huge difference between elevation field and image RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) value field, there are few works that apply image SR methods to the task of DEM SR. Therefore, this paper investigates the question of whether the state-of-the-art image SR methods are appropriate for DEM SR. More specifically, the traditional interpolation method and three excellent SR methods based on neural networks are chosen for comparison. Experimental results suggest that SRGAN (Super-Resolution with Generative Adversarial Network) presents the best performance on accuracy evaluation over a series of DEM SR experiments. © 2022 by the authors.

This study selected several cities in the Yellow River Basin and the Rhine River Basin as examples, using street view images, combining locality theory with computer vision analysis methods, and proposing a framework for quantitative research on locality expression. Then the generation mechanism of the local characteristics was discussed. The results show that the cities in the two countries show significant differences, whereas some cities in the basin are similar. The images of the ‘Built Environment' and ‘Social Life' are more conducive to identifying the cities. The construction qualities of ‘Remains' and ‘Water' are the key built environmental factors for the coexistence of locality differences and similarities. The protection of historic buildings and less manual intervention in the water environment are of great significance to the local shaping of German cities and have reference value for developing Chinese cities.

Traditional walkability calculations are based on Lawrence Frank's theory. However, the weighted calculation method cannot be adapted to ever-changing and complicated scenarios as the scope and topic of research transforming. This study investigated walkability at the community level by combining machine learning techniques with multi-source data. Feature indicators affecting walkability were estimated from multi-source data. Machine learning was used to refine the weighting calculation under the previous indicator framework. We compared the performance of 20 regression models from 6 different machine learning algorithms for estimating the walkability of 14578 communities in downtown Shanghai. It is concluded that the Bagged Tree Model (R2=0.86, RMSE=0.36862) achieves the best performance, which is used to revise the initial walkability index values. The workflow proposed in this paper allows for rapid application of expert empirical consensus to comprehensive urban design and detailed urban governance in the future. © 2022, The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia.

Most studies focus on physical criteria, while perception criteria are less addressed. The correlations between the two are still largely unknown. This paper introduces a methodology that utilises computer vision analysis techniques to evaluate 15,383 Google Street View Images (SVI) of Brisbane City against both physical and perception cycling criteria. The study seeks to better understand correlations between the quality of a street environment and an urban area's 'bicycle-friendliness'. PSPNet Image Segmentation is utilised against SVIs to determine the percentage of an image corresponding with objects and the environment related to specific cycling factors. For physical criteria, these images are then further analysed by Masked RCNN processes. For perception criteria, subjective ranking of the images is undertaken using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to score images based on survey data. The methodology effectively allows for current findings in cycling research to be further utilised in combination via computer visioning (CV) and ML applications to measure different physical elements and urban design qualities that correspond with bicycle-friendliness. Such findings can assist targeted design strategies for cities to encourage the use of safer and more sustainable modes of transport. © 2022, The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia.

The urban environment and building features associated with romantic information are identified by Pearson correlation analysis and annotated in the city map. Then, both city labelled maps and romance heatmaps are fed into a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) as the training dataset to achieve final romance distribution predictions across regions for other cities. The ideal prediction results highlight the ability of deep learning techniques to quantify experience-based decision-making strategies that can be used in further research on urban design. © 2022, The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia.

Modularization is an implementable and financially feasible solution to this problem by enabling supervised machine learning (ML) methods to be applicable over long time scales by minimizing the computational requirements to update physics-based hydrodynamic modelling. Constant updating is necessary as supervised ML methods require a static system to be learned while urban landscapes are dynamic in nature since they're shaped by developmental changes (e.g., reservoirs, detention ponds, urban sprawl, etc.). Minimizing the computational costs to update these physics based PDE solvers enables real-world implementation of ML methods for inundation modelling. In practice, modularization consists of storing internal compute data of the hydrodynamic model and later using that information to construct an external boundary condition for a contiguous subset of the original modelling domain containing the outlet. In a 2D finite volume solver, like HEC-RAS 2D, this can be taken as a connected set of cell faces constructing a perimeter for a single subset of cells, or a module, that can be run in place of the original model for localized edits. We show in a case study (and in a formal proof) that the solution along this perimeter for a localized edit remains unchanged from the solution of the original model. Therefore, the module can replace the full model for updates while maintaining accuracy and minimizing computations. This work unlocks many applications for nearly computationally free, high resolution hydrodynamic modelling such as real-time flood alert systems and probabilistic (Monte Carlo style) floodplain analysis. © Hydrology and Water Resources Symposium, HWRS 2022.

The nonaesthetic refers to physical elements and spatial compositions that make the aesthetic emerge differently depending on the observer who sees them. Using Ashihara’s (1979) methodology for evaluating aesthetic townscapes and Sibley’s (1959) concept of aesthetic properties, this paper proposes a quantification of the nonaesthetic of streetscapes, focusing on streets in Ginza, Tokyo, and examining the spatial clustering of their nonaesthetic. For this, we used deep learning to quantify the distribution of physical elements and their spatial composition and a spatial clustering analysis to uncover hidden patterns in the streetscapes. These methodologies enabled us to assess streets across neighborhoods and districts and produce a comparative microscale analysis that covers a wider area. Thus, our study combines the fields of aesthetics, architecture, urban planning, and community design. © 2022 Psychologia Society.

These extend to various areas in sustainability, including for satellite image analysis to obtain information such as land usage and extent of development. An interesting direction for which data-driven methods have not been applied much yet is in the quick quantitative evaluation of urban layouts for planning and design. In particular, urban designs typically involve complex trade-offs between multiple objectives, including limits on urban build-up and/or consideration of urban heat island effect. Hence, it can be beneficial to urban planners to have a fast surrogate model to predict urban characteristics of a hypothetical layout, e.g. pedestrian-level wind velocity, without having to run compu-tationally expensive and time-consuming high-fidelity numerical simulations each time. This fast surrogate can then be potentially integrated into other design optimization frameworks, including generative models or other gradient-based methods. Here we present an investigation into the use of convolutional neural networks as a surrogate for urban layout characterization that is typically done via high-fidelity numerical simulation. We then further apply this model towards a first demonstration of its utility for data-driven pedestrian-level wind velocity prediction. The data set in this work comprises results from high-fidelity numerical simulations of wind velocities for a diverse set of realistic urban layouts, based on randomized samples from a real-world, highly built-up urban city. We then provide prediction results obtained from the neural network trained on this data-set, demonstrating test errors of under 0.1 m/s for previously unseen novel urban layouts. We further illustrate how this can be useful for purposes such as rapid evaluation of pedestrian wind velocity for a potential new layout. In addition, it is hoped that this data set will further inspire, facilitate and accelerate research in data-driven urban AI, even as our baseline model facilitates quantitative comparison to future, more innovative methods. © 2022 IEEE.",Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Pedestrian Wind Velocity; U-Net; Urban Planning; Urban Wind Flow,Computational fluid dynamics; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Numerical models; Statistical tests; Urban planning; Wind speed; Computational fluid dynamic; Convolutional neural network; Data set; High-fidelity; Pedestrian wind velocity; U-net; Urban wind flows; Velocity prediction; Wind velocities; Convolution,,,,,,,"Lecun, Yann Le, Deep learning, Nature, 521, 7553, pp. 436-444, (2015); Thuerey, Nils, Deep learning methods for reynolds-averaged navier–stokes simulations of airfoil flows, AIAA Journal, 58, 1, pp. 25-36, (2020); Surrogate modeling of fluid dynamics with a multigrid inspired neural network architecture[Formula presented], 6; Rao, Chengping, Physics-informed deep learning for incompressible laminar flows, Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters, 10, 3, pp. 207-212, (2020); Learning Mesh Based Simulation with Graph Networks, (2020); Moosavi, Vahid, Urban morphology meets deep learning: Exploring urban forms in one million cities, towns, and villages across the planet, pp. 379-392, (2022); Cai, Chenyi, Urban morphological feature extraction and multi-dimensional similarity analysis based on deep learning approaches, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 12, (2021); Chen, Wangyang, Classification of urban morphology with deep learning: Application on urban vitality, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 90, (2021); Pan, Zhuokun, Deep learning segmentation and classification for urban village using a worldview satellite image based on U-net, Remote Sensing, 12, 10, (2020); Blocken, Bert J.E., Computational Fluid Dynamics for urban physics: Importance, scales, possibilities, limitations and ten tips and tricks towards accurate and reliable simulations, Building and Environment, 91, pp. 219-245, (2015)",,"Candan, K.S.; Dinh, T.N.; Thai, My.T.; Washio, T.",IEEE Computer Society,IEEE Computer Society; US National Science Foundation (NSF),"22nd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2022",2022-11-28 through 2022-12-01,Orlando,186593,23759232; 23759259,9781728146034; 9798350346091; 9781509054725; 9798350381641; 9781665424271; 9781538692882; 9798331530631; 9781538614808; 9781479942749; 9781728190129,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Urban trees are essential to maintain the good quality of the cities and reduce the effects of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. In this sense, one can cite the tree species diversity as essential to ensuring the preservation and proper functioning of the urban ecosystem and the conservation of the wildlife species in the urban forest environment. Furthermore, tree species play an essential role in assessing the tree risk of falling since the species are related to the wood density, thus providing further details for the tree structural analysis. However, tree species classification involves a time-consuming process that requires allocating human resources for fieldwork. Also, the tree species are quite imbalanced in the urban landscape, requiring a more efficient approach to provide accurate results for minority species. Therefore, computer-aided methods are helpful to support the rapid analysis of the tree species for tasks involving inventory and analysis of the tree conditions. This paper proposes a multiclass extension of the O2 PF, an Optimum-Path Forest-based oversampling method, to generate synthetic samples based on features extracted from images of five urban tree species. Further, we present the so-called 'Street Level Tree Species Classification', a novel dataset for tree species classification based on tree images from the ground-view perspective. Four variants of the multiclass O2 PF were tested and compared to several state-of-the-art oversampling methods found in the literature.

Accordingly, there is a large body of literature studying how individual elements of urban design (e.g., greenery, sport facilities, sitting opportunities, sunlight) affect the intensity, type, and spatial distribution of human activities. These studies are usually bounded to the exploration of a small number of variables as the methodological limitations in terms of the data collection and analysis do not allow to capture the entire complexity of the urban environment. However, these limitations might restrict our understanding of many aspects of human behavior as these are simultaneously affected by a multitude of factors and their interactions. As a result, we argue that there is a need for new methods which can account for the multi-dimensional, non-linear relationship between public space and human activities. This paper presents a methodological approach based on computer-aided data collection as well as state-of-the-art machine learning methods for predictive modeling. To validate the proposed method, we empirically test it on three public spaces (located in Berlin, Germany), focusing on predicting the distribution of sitting activities. The spatial data were represented as a grid with each grid cell containing spatial features related to sitting activities, such as distances to nearby roads, pavement, and visibility. Next, we trained a decision tree model to predict the impact of environmental variables on sitting. Our focus lies on the interpretability of the machine learning model; thus, we demonstrate how the decision tree model can be used to understand the importance of individual features as well as their combination in terms of the effect on sitting activity. Finally, we discuss how this type of model can be applied to explain other types of activities and directly inform the urban planning decisions. © 2022 Proceedings 13th International Space Syntax Symposium, SSS 2022.

Such advances have implications for many applied design disciplines across fashion, art, architecture, urban planning, landscape design and the future tools available to such disciplines. However, a detailed analysis capturing the capabilities of such models, specifically with a focus on the built environment, has not been performed to date. In this work, we investigate the capabilities and biases of such text-to-image methods as it applies to the built environment in detail. We use a systematic grammar to generate queries related to the built environment and evaluate resulting generated images.

This study hypothesizes that ground-level urban-design quality relates to passengers’ perceived safety and actual crime rates, subsequently affecting metro ridership. Current literature lacks intensive investigations into how the intertwined physical features and subjective perceptions of micro-scale street environments around subway stations correlate with crime frequencies. It sets out to quantify the correlations between crime reports and urban design quality within the ¼-mile buffer zone of Manhattan subway entrances with the application of Street View Imagery (SVI) and the artificial intelligence of computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML). Key findings are 1) subjectively and objectively measured urban design quality from SVIs improve explanations of crime. 2) higher perceived safety does not necessarily link with lower crime risks. 3) parks as a point of interest (POI) serve as a crime deterrent.

This dynamic complexity calls into question traditional urban planning and design principles and demands new approaches that can be accomplished using new technologies such as artificial intelligence and specifically machine learning. This need is particularly acute when addressing energy-related issues that are affected by environmental conditions complicated by climate change. Reaching the goal of energy efficient and resilient cities requires moving past building-scale analysis to address the phenomenon at an urban scale. A strategy for reaching energy independency in urban environments has been the development of communities that guarantee the local supply and demand for clean energy, considering both network and building configurations. However, while the spatial development process requires the participation of architects and urban planners, the relationship between urban form and energy performance has not been widely explored in the design of high-performance energy communities, defined herein as minimizing energy demand and exercising the potential for energy self-sufficiency. This may be due to the complexity associated with studying how urban form impacts energy performance and the unavailability of tools for designing and assessing energy performance at this scale. In this study, the use of artificial neural networks is described as a method to unravel the complex, intertwined relationship between urban form and energy demand in communities in the context of San Diego, California, USA. The statistical results of this procedure are interpreted in terms of their architectural implications toward adding a spatial dimension to the existing technical discourse on developing energy-independent communities. The architectural interpretation is then translated into general rules and principles for spatially designing communities in San Diego that would maximize the energy performance of their underlying solar microgrid. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Technological innovations in AI and data analysis are leading to new design strategies and processes in which urban designers must constantly redefine their role in the interaction with digital tools. In this chapter, we demonstrate how various generative and analytical methods can be used to create adaptive master plans (AMPs). AMPs are computational models that are able to generate urban plans based on context information, boundary conditions, and design performance goals. In contrast to traditional urban design models, where one static representation of a design is created, AMPs represent a flexible design solution, allowing the designer—or other stakeholders—to change the input parameters and explore their effects on the resulting design. In this chapter, we briefly summarize the origins of AMPs and show some of their basic components. By means of two examples—the design of numerous small cities in Ethiopia and of a new urban district on Singapore's waterfront, we show the potential that such AMPs have for the creation, analysis, and optimization of urban plans. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

We further describe common types of spatial networks as well as computational social science, its application to urban planning and design problems and how the resulting insights into the dynamics of our cities allow us to uncover and understand their underlying structure. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

As design and planning functions increasingly overlap, it is the hope that technologies like machine learning and other digital tools will evolve and proliferate to enable designers to employ data-driven analyses in informing a wider range of design decisions. This chapter proposes a potential use case for generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the planning and design process. GANs are used to develop novel impressionistic aerial imagery—or urban impressions—based on a variety of inputs common to practice such as variations of land use and/or land cover. The GANs make extensive use of readily-available, tiled, web-format maps in both their training and prediction. The generated urban impressions were evaluated based on a range of qualitative criteria, including their ability to foster increased dialogue between parties. Additionally, this research included the development of a prototype tool that creates urban impressions based on selected inputs early on in the predesign phase. Ultimately, it is the hope that this prototype “sketch tool” will allow practitioners to use GANs to test out initial “sketched” approaches in planning and design and communicate them to the client for early feedback. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Over the years, AI has been defined in many distinct but connected ways, encompassing different subfields and methods. Although in recent years, AI has been equated with machine learning, this chapter explores another AI paradigm, search, and optimization. In the urban design context, artificial intelligence has great potential to enhance decision-making and various assessment processes by performing complex iterations and carrying out predictions speedily and accurately. Proximity, in turn, plays a fundamental role in promoting urban dynamics, influencing city arrangements, and impacting the overall quality of life. Important urban features related to sustainable urban design practices such as transit accessibility, density, land-use diversity, and walkability, which are crucial for easing traffic congestion and improving public health, can be either assessed or explained by proximity indicators. This chapter investigates the utility of computational optimization techniques at the urban design scale, aiming to improve the performance of urban grid layouts according to the physical and topological proximity metrics. To this end, we employ evolutionary multiobjective optimization, a subset of evolutionary computation, and a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm in the generation of urban fabrics and analyze the outcomes of orthogonal and nonorthogonal grid typologies, including regular orthogonal grid, irregular orthogonal grid, irregular nonorthogonal grid, and Voronoi-shaped grid. During the generation of optimal urban grid layouts, computational tools measure the shortest physical distance between locations in a neighborhood and verify Space Syntax measures such as integration and connectivity. Our results indicate the advantages and drawbacks of each grid typology, identifying that orthogonal grids are more appropriate for car-oriented cities, while nonorthogonal ones are more suitable for walkable areas. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The concept of imageability is important for architects and urban designers, so that their creations meet the needs of the citizens and improve the aesthetics of the place. Recently, computer vision and textual analysis techniques have been investigated for calculating the imageability of a place. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal system that utilises both visual and textual analysis methods to estimate the imageability score of a place. In addition, an image sentiment analysis deep learning model had been developed to provide supplementary information about the sentiment that is evoked to citizens by urban locations. Finally, a text generation algorithm is used to provide an explanation of the information extracted by the data analysis in a form of text to facilitate the works of architects and urban designers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Imageability; Text analysis; Urban design; Visual analysis,Deep learning; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Sentiment analysis; Imageability; Multi-modal; Physical objects; Text analysis; Textual-analysis; Urban design; Urban designers; Urban environments; Urban planners; Visual analysis; Modal analysis,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (825079); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020",Funding text 1: Acknowledgments..

It is well known for its ethnic and prehistoric culture, folk songs, rare stones, and urban landscape. The demand of tourism in Liuzhou city is increasing day by day. Therefore, a system is needed to accurately predict the increasing demand of tourism in Liuzhou city. For this reason, based on the examination of historical visitor data in natural sites especially in Liuzhou city, this research employs an important machine learning and deep learning approach. The purpose of this study is to identify the consumption patterns and improve prediction, prejudgment, and preparation abilities by incorporating them into an intelligent tourism service platform, preventing visitors from travelling at inconvenient times and providing appropriate suggestions to scenic site managers. In this paper, the Sparse Principal Component Analysis-Long-Short-Term Memory (SPCA-LSTM) model has been updated to the Sparse Principal Component Analysis Convolutional Neural Network Long-Short-Term Memory (SPCA-CNNLSTM) model to accurately predict the tourist traffic during the holidays. Convolutional and pooling layers are added to the network topology to extract the local characteristics of the input data. The data of passenger traffic and influencing factors of Liuzhou scenic area from the months of Sept. 2015 to Nov. 2019 were used as the data set for the experiments. A hybrid-forecasting model is also proposed in the paper, which first removes noise from international crude oil data using compression-aware denoising preprocessing and then combines compression-aware denoising with machine learning using artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR). The experimental result shows that the SPCA-CNNLSTM model predicts better values than the SPCA-LSTM model. © 2022 Wenqing Li.",,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Convolutional neural network; De-noising; Folk songs; Machine-learning; Memory modeling; On-machines; Region-based; Sparse principal component analysis; Tourism demand; Urban landscape; Long short-term memory,,,,,,,"Wang, Meiyu, Forecast and Application of GA Optimization BP Neural Network Tourism Demand in High-speed Railway Era, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 569, 4, (2019); Lu, Qikai, Retrieval of water quality from uav-borne hyperspectral imagery: A comparative study of machine learning algorithms, Remote Sensing, 13, 19, (2021); Guo, Shuze, Urban tourism competitiveness evaluation system and its application: Comparison and analysis of regression and classification methods, Procedia Computer Science, 162, pp. 429-437, (2019); Wu, Jiansheng, A novel hybrid genetic algorithm and Simulated Annealing for feature selection and kernel optimization in support vector regression, pp. 401-406, (2012); Tang, Tianli, Multi-stage deep learning approaches to predict boarding behaviour of bus passengers, Sustainable Cities and Society, 73, (2021); Xia, Guoen, Prediction of logistics demand based on grey neural network ensemble, pp. 358-366, (2017); Wu, Zhauhua, Ensemble empirical mode decomposition: A noise-assisted data analysis method, Advances in Adaptive Data Analysis, 1, 1, pp. 1-41, (2009); Zola, Paola, A Google Trends spatial clustering approach for a worldwide Twitter user geolocation, Information Processing and Management, 57, 6, (2020); Lu, Jing, Influence of transportation network on transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in China, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 129, (2021); Wu, Jiansheng, Support vector regression based on particle swarm optimization and projection pursuit technology for rainfall forecasting, 1, pp. 227-233, (2009)","W.

Firstly, the landscape index was analyzed effectively, and the Markov model was used to predict land use change, which provided a theoretical basis for the analysis of urban landscape change. Then the GeoSOS-FLUS model based on deep learning is used to make up for the lack of diversity of land use types by using the suitability probability calculation module of ANN and the adaptive inertia and competition mechanism, and the competition between different land use types is introduced.

V., Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","This paper analyzes the leading role of information and communications technology in developing territories based on the smart city concept. It is noted that the main significance of this concept is the ability to quickly process large amounts of information, to join together the interests of managers, businesses and the population, and to calculate the current and future demands of an area and its consumer groups within the selected positive growth scenario. An example of such solutions is the “living urban technology labs”, where the situation in a specific area is assessed using artificial intelligence and ICT development, and this assessment is then used to design urban landscapes with affordable housing, healthcare services, including telehealth, as well as traffic control and other sectors. Researching the role of information and communications technology in the development of a territory based on designing “smart cities” suggests a need to: 1) assess the role of the smart city concept in transforming territories based on adopting information and communications technology; 2) validate the possibilities of Russian regions where megapolises are the driving force in the positive transformation of the socio-economic system of a territory on a digital basis to provide an information and communications infrastructure. In Russia, the driving forces in the development of the smart city concept are modern large cities, in the majority of which initiatives on positively transforming the planning and management strategy for a smart urban environment are being carried out. With their developed ICT, they help generate the growth of their local region, contributing to its transformation into a smart territory. Foreign experience concerning both local examples of renovating industrial regions of urban areas as well as scaling the smart city concept within the framework of interregional projects similar to the experience of China can be demanded and tested in Russia, above all, in regions with the most developed ICT today. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Concept scaling; Development drivers; Information and communications technology; Megapolises; Smart cities; Smart territories,Economics; Medical computing; Population statistics; Urban planning; Amount of information; Concept scaling; Development driver; Driving forces; Information and Communication Technologies; Large amounts; Megapolises; Paper analysis; Scalings; Smart territory; Smart city,,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (20-010-00942 A.); Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ","The reported study was funded by RFBR, project number 20-010-00942 A.","undefined; undefined; undefined; Unecon News 51 119, (2019); undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; Statistical Bulletin Federal State Statistics Service M 1242, (2020)","V.

However, its performance in calibrating cellular automata (CA) for urban growth simulation has not been investigated. This study compares the MaxEnt model with logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) models to explore its advantages in simulating urban growth and interpreting driving mechanisms. With the land use data of 2000 and 2020 from GlobeLand30, the constructed LR-CA, ANN-CA, SVM-CA, and MaxEnt-CA models are applied to simulate the urban growth of Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan, respectively. Their performance has been evaluated from multiple aspects such as the accuracy of training, testing, and projecting, computational efficiency, simulation accuracy, and simulated urban landscape. The results indicate that the MaxEnt model is superior to the other models except for the computational efficiency, but the time required for the MaxEnt training and projecting is acceptable and far less than that of the SVM. Taking the LR-CA as the benchmark, the kappa coefficients (Kappa) of the MaxEnt-CA have been increased by 4.20%, 3.38%, and 5.87% in Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan, respectively; the increments of corresponding figure of merits (FoM) are 6.26%, 4.58%, and 8.49%. The driving mechanisms of urban growth such as the interactions, response curves, and importance of spatial variables, have also been revealed by the MaxEnt modeling. The driving mechanisms of urban growth in Tianjin are more complex than that in Beijing and Wuhan, because there are more variable interactions; the relationships between spatial factors and urban growth in the three study areas are all nonlinear; the topographic factors and city center of Beijing, the traffic factors and water bodies of Tianjin, and the traffic factors, city center and water bodies of Wuhan are significant factors affecting their urban growth. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, errors in the mapping result are expected since not all land-cover changes are flood-induced, and those changes are sensitive to SAR data, such as crop growth or harvest over agricultural lands, clearance of forested areas, and/or modifications on the urban landscape. This study, therefore, incorporated historical SAR images to boost the detection of flood-induced changes during extreme weather events, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. Additionally, to incorporate the spatial signatures for the change detection, we applied a deep learning-based spatiotemporal simulation framework, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), for simulating a synthetic image using Sentinel One intensity time series. This synthetic image will be prepared in advance of flood events, and then it can be used to detect flood areas using change detection when the post-image is available. Practically, significant divergence between the synthetic image and post-image is expected over inundated zones, which can be mapped by applying thresholds to the Delta image (synthetic image minus post-image). We trained and tested our model on three events from Australia, Brazil, and Mozambique. The generated Flood Proxy Maps were compared against reference data derived from Sentinel Two and Planet Labs optical data. To corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we also generated Delta products for two baseline models (closest post-image minus pre-image and historical mean minus post-image) and two LSTM architectures: normal LSTM and ConvLSTM. Results show that thresholding of ConvLSTM Delta yielded the highest Cohen’s Kappa coefficients in all study cases: 0.92 for Australia, 0.78 for Mozambique, and 0.68 for Brazil. Lower Kappa values obtained in the Mozambique case can be subject to the topographic effect on SAR imagery. These results still confirm the benefits in terms of classification accuracy that convolutional operations provide in time series analysis of satellite data employing spatially correlated information in a deep learning framework. © 2022 by the authors.

They should allow authorities to make inter‐city comparisons, considering specific cities and their objects against the background of others undergoing similar development processes. In this article, the authors propose strategic initiatives for the management of urban facilities. In particular, the authors’ approach to the assessment of the sustainable development of housing and communal service facilities in the city is proposed. According to the authors, the housing and communal city service objects mean capital construction objects in different forms of reproduction. Moreover, the article examines both residential buildings and structures, and utility networks. The authors’ approach consists in the constant assessment of the city’s housing and communal service facilities at different stages of their operation. For this, the authors use several types of analysis: ex post analysis, ex ante analysis, and foresight analysis. For each type of analysis, the authors form a set of assessment indicators and indicate the period of the analysis. The result of the study is the development of an indicator for the assessment of the level of sustainable development of housing and communal service facilities in the city, and a roadmap for their development strategy. The roadmap is formed considering the introduction of modern end‐to‐end technologies and digital tools into the work of state bodies. The proposed approach, on the one hand, considers the internal complexity and heterogeneity of the city’s housing and communal service facilities. On the other hand, it is a simple tool for the making of effective management decisions by power structures, as it uses data which are available on a regular basis. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there is a global difference in the composition of this toolkit in the Russian Federation and in foreign countries. This difference is mainly due to the rights of homeowners. In international practice, the priority in making decisions regarding the management of a residential building belongs to the owners [25–30]. These overseas homeowners unite in a non‐profit consumer organization. This organization unites owners of real estate objects or shareholders. This organization’s purpose is to manage the complex of the real estate, and to ensure the operation of this comple and the posses‐ sion, use and disposal of property. The homeowner’s association has become a general‐ izing concept of housing cooperation in various legal forms, such as Planning Unit De‐ velopments, Condominium Associations, and Housing Cooperatives in the United States and Canada; syndicates in France; and apartment joint stock companies in Finland [22,31–33]. In European countries, residents themselves monitor the house condition and re‐ ceive financial support from the authorities. For example, in Germany, France and Hol‐ land, people have the right, in agreement with the municipality, to build (including with the involvement of investors) an object of shared ownership on their land plot, and to save money for overhaul during the operation [28,29,34]. Furthermore, in some countries, there are a state grants system and subsidies for major repairs of houses: they provide the authorities with a project of work, and, if it meets the approved criteria, they receive state aid [29,35–38].; Funding text 2: This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, grant number 075?15?2021?686.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the performance of two-dimensional land cover classification can be improved by fusing optical imagery and LiDAR data using several strategies. However, few studies have focused on the fusion of LiDAR point clouds and optical imagery for three-dimensional land cover classification, especially using a deep learning framework. In this study, we proposed a novel prior-level fusion strategy and compared it with the no-fusion strategy (baseline) and three other commonly used fusion strategies (point-level, feature-level, and decision-level). The proposed prior-level fusion strategy uses two-dimensional land cover derived from optical imagery as the prior knowledge for three-dimensional classification. Then, a LiDAR point cloud is linked to the prior information using the nearest neighbor method and classified by a deep neural network. Our proposed prior-fusion strategy has higher overall accuracy (82.47%) on data from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, compared with the baseline (74.62%), point-level (79.86%), feature-level (76.22%), and decision-level (81.12%). The improved accuracy reflects two features: (1) fusing optical imagery to LiDAR point clouds improves the performance of three-dimensional urban land cover classification, and (2) the proposed prior-level strategy directly uses semantic information provided by the two-dimensional land cover classification rather than the original spectral information of optical imagery. Furthermore, the proposed prior-level fusion strategy provides a series that fills the gap between two-and three-dimensional land cover classification. © 2021 by the authors.

To address the urgent need for urban landscape mapping that goes beyond urban footprint analysis, the local climate zone (LCZ) scheme has been increasingly used to reveal the urban forms and functions important to urban heat islands and micro-climates across the globe. As with most supervised classification strategies, proper application of training data is critical for the success of LCZ classification models. However, the collection and application of LCZ training areas brings with it two challenges that may affect mapping success. First, because digitizing training areas is a time-consuming task, there is a broad effort in the LCZ mapping community to create a crowdsourced data collection among different experts. However, this strategy likely leads to inconsistencies in labels that could weaken models. Second, the LCZ labeling process typically involves the delineation of large zones from which multiple training samples are drawn, but those samples are likely spatially autocorrelated and lead to overly optimistic estimates of model accuracy. Although both effects – inconsistent labeling and spatial autocorrelation – are theoretically possible, it is unknown whether they substantially affect accuracy. We investigated both issues, specifically asking: (i) how do the discrepancies of LCZ labeling by different experts impact broad-scale LCZ mapping? (ii) to what extent does spatial correlation affect model prediction power? We used two classifiers (Random Forests and ResNets) to map eight metropolitan areas in the US into LCZs, comparing training areas drawn by different or consistent interpreters, and data splitting strategy using rules that allow or reduce spatial autocorrelation. We found large discrepancies among results built from crowdsourced training areas digitized by different experts; improving the consistency of labels can lead to substantial improvements in LCZ classification accuracy. Second, we found that spatial autocorrelation can boost the apparent accuracy of the classifier by 16% to 21%, leading to erroneous interpretation of mapping results. The two effects interplay as well: spatial autocorrelation in the raw data can lead to an underestimation of the model's predictive error when modeling with crowdsourced training areas of high inconsistency. Due to the uncertainty in the labeling process and spatial autocorrelation in derived training data, broad-scale LCZ mapping results should be interpreted with caution. © 2021 The Authors",Crowdsourced data; Local climate zone; Machine learning; Spatial autocorrelation; Training areas,autocorrelation; data set; machine learning; mapping method; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization,,,,,,,"Agathangelidis, Ilias, Integrating urban form, function, and energy fluxes in a heat exposure indicator in view of intra-urban heat island assessment and climate change adaptation, Climate, 7, 6, (2019); Bechtel, Benjamin, Generating WUDAPT Level 0 data – Current status of production and evaluation, Urban Climate, 27, pp. 24-45, (2019); Bechtel, Benjamin, Mapping local climate zones for a worldwide database of the form and function of cities, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 4, 1, pp. 199-219, (2015); undefined, (2017); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); undefined, (1984); Demuzere, Matthias, Mapping Europe into local climate zones, PLOS ONE, 14, 4, (2019); Demuzere, Matthias, Combining expert and crowd-sourced training data to map urban form and functions for the continental US, Scientific Data, 7, 1, (2020); undefined; Dhar, Tapan Kumar, A multi-scale and multi-dimensional framework for enhancing the resilience of urban form to climate change, Urban Climate, 19, pp. 72-91, (2017)","C.

For the latter, urban planners apply a precautionary principle, which is normally not grounded in the actual performance of the urban drainage system (UDS). This approach, however, fails during weather extremes with heavy precipitation. This paper presents a new concept for reducing pluvial flood risks in the urban planning process. The novelty of the developed planning support system named Extreme Weather Layer (EWL) is that it creates dynamic interlinkages between land developments, the performance of UDS, and other factors that contribute to flood risk. The EWL is built on the digital twin of the existing UDS and delivers an easy-to-use concept, where the end user can analyze hydraulic modelling results interlinked with climate scenarios using the GIS platform. This allows planning specialists to consider land use and soil types in the urban environment to simulate the response of the storm water system and the catchments to different rainfall events. This proposed approach was piloted in Haapsalu (Estonia) and Söderhamn (Sweden). The resulting planning support system, which performs as a set of layers within municipalities’ GIS, allows decision makers to understand and predict the impact of various spatial planning decisions on the pluvial flood risk. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous studies have lacked human-oriented technical paths and high-throughput datasets to quantify physical and psychological perceptions in different land-use scenarios. This paper adopts a novel transfer learning approach to quantify the six types of landsense indices (LSIs) as psychological perception metrics and employs panoptic segmentation to parameterize the view index (VI) and the number of foreground instances (NFIs) as physical perception measures. Then, a quantitative analysis is conducted in Beijing's six Ring Road areas, and the connections between people's physical and psychological perceptions of heterogeneous land use are explored. The landsense maps can depict the distribution of LSIs and facilitate the understanding of complex perceptions distributed at a large scale. The regression model shows that natural landscapes (trees, grasses, and mountains) in the Beijing built-up area exhibit an overall positive performance. Moreover, for several block-level land uses, industrial scenery is related to overall negative psychological feelings. Parks and green spaces are positively related to psychological perceptions, because of the greater exposure opportunities to natural landscapes for residents. The framework in this research has potential in assisting urban planning and land-use management, and it enriches the datasets with extensive information, thereby improving the psychological perceptions of urban scenes from residents’ perspectives. The novel approaches in this paper take a step forward in quantifying and understanding the public perceptions of urban landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Cityscapes; Complex perceptions; Deep learning; Human-oriented; Image big data; Massive street-view datasets,data set; greenspace; machine learning; perception; psychology; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Poaceae,,,,,"Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA23030403); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFC0503605); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","All authors dedicate this article to the memory of Prof. Jingzhu Zhao, a great sustainability specialist, leader and mentor.

The effects will depend on the magnitude of projected land use and climate changes and lake sensitivity to these factors. We used random forests fit with long-term (1971–2016) phytoplankton and cyanobacteria abundance time series, climate observations (1971–2016), and upstream catchment land use (global Clumondo models for the year 2000) data from 14 European and 15 North American lakes basins. We projected future phytoplankton and cyanobacteria abundance in the 29 focal lake basins and 1567 lakes across focal regions based on three land use (sustainability, middle of the road, and regional rivalry) and two climate (RCP 2.6 and 8.5) scenarios to mid-21st century. On average, lakes are expected to have higher phytoplankton and cyanobacteria due to increases in both urban land use and temperature, and decreases in forest habitat. However, the relative importance of land use and climate effects varied substantially among regions and lakes. Accounting for land use and climate changes in a combined way based on extensive data allowed us to identify urbanization as the major driver of phytoplankton development in lakes located in urban areas, and climate as major driver in lakes located in remote areas where past and future land use changes were minimal. For approximately one-third of the studied lakes, both drivers were relatively important. The results of this large scale study suggest the best approaches for mitigating the effects of human activity on lake phytoplankton and cyanobacteria will depend strongly on lake sensitivity to long-term change and the magnitude of projected land use and climate changes at a given location. Our quantitative analyses suggest local management measures should focus on retaining nutrients in urban landscapes to prevent nutrient pollution from exacerbating ongoing changes to lake ecosystems from climate change. © 2021 The Authors.

The perceived element for older adults' involvement in the environment differs from the average person. Despite this difference, there is little to no research into understanding how the perceived elements (specifically, the visuospatial configuration) of the environment influence older adults' involvement—most studies focused on younger adults. The focus here is stress, which occurs when environmental demand exceeds a person's capability. As stress impacts a person's involvement in the environment and older adults are more likely to feel stress due to their decline in functional capability, it is important to understand how the visuospatial configuration of urban environment influence stress. Older adults were recruited to participate in an urban environment walk while their physiological responses (Photoplethysmogram) were monitored using wearable sensors. Their perceived stress responses were also collected. Spatial clustering and hot spot analysis were conducted to detect locations with clusters of physiological responses caused by spatial factors. These locations were subsequently labelled as stress or non-stress based on participants' perceived stress. The perceived visual elements of the urban environment were extracted using isovist analysis. Principal component analysis, self-organising map and machine learning algorithms were used to understand the relationship. The results demonstrate that isovist minimum visibility, occlusivity, and isovist area are the most influential determinants of older adults' physiological stress. Older adults prefer urban configurations where they can be seen. This study can be used to inform urban design and planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Isovist analysis; Machine learning; Older adult; Person-environment interaction; Physiological stress; Self-organising map,Data mining; Learning algorithms; Physiological models; Physiology; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Urban planning; Wearable technology; Environment influence; Isovist analysis; Isovists; Older adults; Person-environment interaction; Physiological response; Physiological stress; Population aging; Stress sensing; Urban environments; Machine learning; data mining; elderly population; machine learning; perception; physiological response; urban area,,,,,"Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (PF17-02405); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong through the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme [reference number PF17-02405]; and the Department of Building and Real Estate, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge the Institute of Active Ageing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, in particular, Prof. Daniel W.L.

It also has positive effects on urban vibrancy, public health, and social connections in that community. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the visual quality at the urban street level using street view images. However, the spatial distribution of fine-grained visual quality inside an urban street is rarely investigated. This study presents a new approach for the evaluation of visual quality inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR point clouds. The semantic information of urban streets was first extracted from mobile LiDAR point clouds with a Gradient Boosting classifier. After that, seven well-known key design elements, including the green space factor, sky view factor, enclosure rate, volume index, vehicle occurrence rate, motorization rate, and diversity, were calculated from the classified point clouds using a three-dimensional (3D) visibility model. Finally, the visual quality at 1 m grid resolution inside urban street was achieved automatically by using a random forest model which was trained based on perception samples. This approach has been validated on two study areas and the results indicated that the proposed approach is able to quantitatively examine the visual quality difference inside urban streets. The results generated by the proposed method also match well with the common sense of urban design experts, which are useful for architects and designers to develop best practices in the urban micro-renewal project and to refine the urban planning processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Fine-scale; Machine learning; Mobile LiDAR; Urban street; Visual quality,3D modeling; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Learning systems; Optical radar; Semantics; Urban planning; Fine grained; Fine-scale; Machine-learning; Mobile LiDAR; Point-clouds; Quality distribution; Social connection; Urban community; Urban streets; Visual qualities; Quality control; automation; best management practice; classification; GIS; lidar; machine learning; mobile communication; mobile phone; model validation; public health; quantitative analysis; spatial distribution; three-dimensional modeling; urban area; urban planning; urban renewal; visualization,,,,,"(19YF1413800); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (41871331, 42001357); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021T140207); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42001357 and 41871331 ), the Shanghai Sailing Program (No. 19YF1413800 ), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2021T140207 ).","Tang, Jingxian, Measuring visual quality of street space and its temporal variation: Methodology and its application in the Hutong area in Beijing, Landscape and Urban Planning, 191, (2019); Ye, Yu, The visual quality of streets: A human-centred continuous measurement based on machine learning algorithms and street view images, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 46, 8, pp. 1439-1457, (2019); Handy, Susan L., How the built environment affects physical activity: Views from urban planning, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 23, 2 SUPPL. 1, pp. 64-73, (2002); Frank, Lawrence Douglas, The built environment and human activity patterns: Exploring the impacts of urban form on public health, Journal of Planning Literature, 16, 2, pp. 202-218, (2001); Hankey, Steve, Urban Form, Air Pollution, and Health, Current Environmental Health Reports, 4, 4, pp. 491-503, (2017); Jackson, Richard J.J., Health and the built environment: 10 years after, American Journal of Public Health, 103, 9, pp. 1542-1544, (2013); Jiang, Bin, A dose of nature: Tree cover, stress reduction, and gender differences, Landscape and Urban Planning, 132, pp. 26-36, (2014); Jahani, Ali, Forest landscape visual quality evaluation using artificial intelligence techniques as a decision support system, Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 34, 10, pp. 1473-1486, (2020); Dumbaugh, Eric, Safe urban form: Revisiting the relationship between community design and traffic safety, Journal of the American Planning Association, 75, 3, pp. 309-329, (2009); Middel, Ariane C., Sky View Factor footprints for urban climate modeling, Urban Climate, 25, pp. 120-134, (2018)","J.

In high-resolution image classification over urban areas, objects with diverse vertical structures make urban landscape more heterogeneous in 3-D space and consequently can make the classification challenging. In this article, a novel multiangle gray-level cooccurrence tensor feature is proposed based on the multiview bands of the ZY-3 imagery, namely, GLCMMA-T. The GLCMMA-T feature captures the distributions of the gray-level spatial variation under different viewing angles, which can depict the 3-D textures and structures of urban objects. The spectral and GLCMMA-T tensor features are interpreted by two 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) streams and then concatenated as the input to the fully connected layer. This novel multispectral and multiangle 3-D convolutional neural network (M2-3-DCNN) combines the spectral and angular information, and the fused feature has the potential to provide a comprehensive description of urban objects with complex vertical structures. The experimental results on ZY-3 multiview images from four test areas indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the classification accuracy when compared with several state-of-the-art multiangle features and deep-learning-based image classification methods. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",Convolutional neural network (CNN); gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM); high-resolution image classification; multiangle (MA); tensor,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification; Image enhancement; Multilayer neural networks; Tensors; Textures; Classification accuracy; Classification methods; High resolution image; Satellite images; Spatial variations; State of the art; Structural feature; Vertical structures; Classification (of information); accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; image classification; satellite altimetry; satellite imagery; spatial variation; spectral analysis; urban area; ZiYuan,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41701382, 41771360); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (2017CFA029); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB0501403); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2016YFB0501403, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41701382 and Grant 41771360, in part by the National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals, and in part by the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 2017CFA029.","Yuan, Yuan, Hyperspectral image classification via multitask joint sparse representation and stepwise MRF optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 46, 10, pp. 2966-2977, (2015); Hong, Danfeng, An Augmented Linear Mixing Model to Address Spectral Variability for Hyperspectral Unmixing, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 28, 4, pp. 1923-1938, (2019); Albanwan, Hessah, A novel spectrum enhancement technique for multi-temporal, multi-spectral data using spatial-temporal filtering, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 142, pp. 51-63, (2018); Haralick, Robert Martin, Textural Features for Image Classification, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-3, 6, pp. 610-621, (1973); Jia, Sen, A 3-D Gabor Phase-Based Coding and Matching Framework for Hyperspectral Imagery Classification, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 48, 4, pp. 1176-1188, (2018); Zhu, Changqing, Study of remote sensing image texture analysis and classification using wavelet, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 19, 16, pp. 3197-3203, (1998); Regniers, Olivier, Supervised Classification of Very High Resolution Optical Images Using Wavelet-Based Textural Features, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 54, 6, pp. 3722-3735, (2016); Zhang, Liangpei, A pixel shape index coupled with spectral information for classification of high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 44, 10, pp. 2950-2961, (2006); Dalla Mura, Mauro, Morphological attribute profiles for the analysis of very high resolution images, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 48, 10, pp. 3747-3762, (2010); Pham, Minh Tan, Local Feature-Based Attribute Profiles for Optical Remote Sensing Image Classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 56, 2, pp. 1199-1212, (2018)","J.

In this paper, the implications of the application of artificial-intelligence-based tools and geo-localised big data, both in solving specific research problems in the field of urban planning and design as well as on planning practice, are discussed. The paper is concluded with both cognitive conclusions and recommendations for planning practice. It is directed towards urban planners interested in the emerging urban big data analytics based on AI-related tools and towards urban theorists working on new methods of describing urban change. © 2021 by the author.

This pipeline introduces three new features: First, strategies of both data-level fusion (i.e., channel expansion on convolutional neural networks) and feature-level fusion were integrated into the object detection model to allow simultaneous machine learning from multi-source data, including remote sensing imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. Second, a new data fusion strategy was developed to blend DEM data and its derivatives to create a new, fused data source with enriched information content and image features. The model has also enabled deep learning by combining both the proposed data fusion and feature-level fusion strategies to yield a much-improved detection result. Third, two different sets of data augmentation techniques were applied to the multi-source training data to further improve the model performance. A series of experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in multi-source deep learning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Data enrichment; Deep Learning; GeoAI; Multi-source data fusion; Object detection,Convolutional neural networks; Data fusion; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Object recognition; Pipelines; Remote sensing; Surveying; Data enrichments; Deep learning; Digital elevation model data; Feature-level fusions; Features detections; GeoAI; Multi-source data fusion; Multi-Sources; Multisource data; Natural features; Object detection; artificial intelligence; computer simulation; detection method; machine learning; urban design; urban development,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1853864, 2120943); National Science Foundation, NSF",This project is funded in part by the National Science Foundation (Nos. 1853864 and 2120943 ).,"Bay, Herbert, SURF: Speeded up robust features, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3951 LNCS, pp. 404-417, (2006); Dalal, Navneet, Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection, I, pp. 886-893, (2005); Doherty, Patrick, A UAV search and rescue scenario with human body detection and geolocalization, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4830 LNAI, pp. 1-13, (2007); Du, Lin, Multi-modal deep learning for landform recognition, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 158, pp. 63-75, (2019); Evans, Ian S., Geomorphometry and landform mapping: What is a landform?, Geomorphology, 137, 1, pp. 94-106, (2012); Felzenszwalb, Pedro F., A discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable part model, (2008); Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision Eccv, (2018); Girshick, Ross B., Fast R-CNN, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015 International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2015, pp. 1440-1448, (2015); Girshick, Ross B., Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 580-587, (2014); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016)","W.

They tend to explore only the association established between a single factor and the distribution of crime. In order to more accurately and quickly visualize and predict crime distribution in different neighborhoods, and to provide a basis for security planning and design by planning designers, this paper uses GAN neural networks to build a prediction model of city floor plans and corresponding crime distribution maps. We take Philadelphia as the research sample, use more than 2 million crime information of Philadelphia from 2006 to 2018 to draw the crime hotspot distribution map, and collect the corresponding map of Philadelphia, and train the model for predicting the crime rate of the city with more than two thousand sets of one-to-one corresponding images as the training set. When the training is complete, a floor plan can be fed directly to the model, and the model will immediately feed back a hotspot map reflecting the crime distribution. Using the untrained Philadelphia data as the test set, the model can accurately predict crime concentration areas and the predicted crime concentration areas are similar to the concentration areas considered in previous studies. With the feedback from the model, the city layout can be adjusted and the crime rate can be greatly reduced when the simulated city planner tunes into the city plan. In addition the ideas in this paper can be applied as a set of methodologies to predict other relevant urban characteristic parameters and visualize them. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Big data analysis; Crime rate; Machine learning; Urban design,Big data; Floors; Forecasting; Machine learning; Big data analyse; Crime rate; Distribution maps; Floorplans; Hotspots; Neighbourhood; Number of methods; Philadelphia; Urban design; Urban neighborhood; Crime,,,,,,,"Historical Homicide Hot Spots the Case of Three Cities, (2001); Hussein, Heba Adel Ahmed, Crime in relation to urban design.

Though previous studies have examined the effects of various urban features on how much children play and where they play, such studies rely on quantitative measurements of play such as the precise location of play and the duration of play time, while people's subjective feelings regarding the playability of their environment are overlooked. In this study, we capture people's perception of place playability by employing Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to classify street view images. A deep learning model trained on the labelled data is then used to evaluate neighborhood playability for three U.S. cities: Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco. Finally, multivariate and geographically weighted regression models are used to explore how various urban features are associated with playability. We find that higher traffic speeds and crime rates are negatively associated with playability, while higher scores for perception of beauty are positively associated with playability. Interestingly, a place that is perceived as lively may not be playable. Our research provides helpful insights for urban planning focused on sustainable city growth and development, as well as for research focused on creating nourishing environments for child development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Deep learning; Human perception of place; Playability; Street view images,Regression analysis; Urban growth; Amazon mechanical turks; Child development; Childhood development; Geographically weighted regression models; Growth and development; Precise locations; Quantitative measurement; Sustainable cities; Deep learning; artificial intelligence; computer simulation; image analysis; machine learning; smart city; sustainability; urban design; urban development; urban growth; urban planning; Boston; California; Massachusetts; San Francisco [California]; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States],,,,,"Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, WARF; Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison, VCRGE, UW; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41901321, 41971366)","The authors would like to thank the support from the Microsoft AI for Earth Program and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41971366 , 41901321 ) to our study.

However, the simplified roof geometry included in these 3D city models and the lack of additional semantic information about the buildings' roof often yield less accurate solar potential evaluations than desirable. In this paper we propose three different methods to infer and store additional information into 3D city models, namely on physical obstacles present on the roof and existing solar panels. Both can be used to increase the accuracy of roof solar panel retrofit potential. These methods are developed and tested on the open datasets available in the Netherlands, specifically AHN3 lidar point-cloud and PDOK aerial photography. However, we believe they can be adapted to different environments as well, based on the available datasets and their precision locally available. © 2021 I.

This paper outlines the use of a supervised machine learning technique to understand the effects of the urban fabric on surface urban heat island (SUHI) formation in Istanbul, and identify effective variables to provide a basis for research and practice focusing on SUHI mitigation. An analysis using the Ridge Regression Model found that 71% of land surface temperature anomalies in Istanbul are linked to building coverage ratio (BCR), surface/volume ratio (SVR), sky-view factor (SVF), canyon geometry factor (CGF), and vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI and BCR were the urban fabric components with the highest contribution to SUHI formation, while the effects of SVF and CGF remained relatively low. This research can help planners and designers gauge the contribution of the urban fabric to micro-climate issues and adapt SUHI mitigation strategies for projects aiming to build climate-sensitive urban environments. It also provides insight into and improves knowledge of supervised machine learning approaches to the urban planning and design disciplines. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Istanbul; Land surface temperature; Ridge regression model; Surface urban heat island; Urban fabric,Atmospheric temperature; Land surface temperature; Landforms; Supervised learning; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Thermal pollution; Urban planning; Building coverage ratios; Geometry factors; Island formation; Istanbul; Ridge regression model; Sky view factor; Supervised machine learning; Surface urban heat islands; Urban fabrics; Regression analysis; heat island; land surface; machine learning; regression analysis; surface temperature; temperature anomaly; urban design; urban planning; Istanbul [Istanbul (PRV)]; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey,,,,,,"This paper was produced from the PhD dissertation conducted by the corresponding author under the supervision of the second author.

Most developed cities have suffered from severe air quality as population growth and industrialization grow rapidly. Government agencies and citizens are increasingly concerned about air quality, which has an impact on various areas of the human environment and human advancement. Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods. © 2021",Deep learning; Smart City (SC); Smart environment design planning; Statistical model,Air quality; Brain; Forecasting; Population statistics; Quality control; Signal encoding; Smart city; Uncertainty analysis; Autoencoders; Deep learning; Design planning; Environment design; Machine-learning; Short term memory; Smart environment; Smart environment design planning; Statistic modeling; Long short-term memory; air quality; atmospheric pollution; industrialization; machine learning; population growth; smart city; uncertainty analysis; urban design; urban planning,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51808042, 51978058); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","1.National Natural Science Foundation Youth Project, Research on Green Evolution Mechanism and Cooperative Planning Method of “Hollow Village” in Qinba Mountains(51808042)2.the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number(51978058)","Jabareen, Yosef Rafeq, Planning the resilient city: Concepts and strategies for coping with climate change and environmental risk, Cities, 31, pp. 220-229, (2013); Macke, Janaina, Smart city and quality of life: Citizens’ perception in a Brazilian case study, Journal of Cleaner Production, 182, pp. 717-726, (2018); Jegadeesan, Subramani, An efficient anonymous mutual authentication technique for providing secure communication in mobile cloud computing for smart city applications, Sustainable Cities and Society, 49, (2019); Ambituuni, Ambisisi, Analysis of safety and environmental regulations for downstream petroleum industry operations in Nigeria: Problems and prospects, Environmental Development, 9, 1, pp. 43-60, (2014); Sekaran, Kaushik, Smart agriculture management system using internet of things, Telkomnika (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 18, 3, pp. 1275-1284, (2020); Gomathi, P., Concurrent service access and management framework for user-centric future internet of things in smart cities, Complex and Intelligent Systems, 7, 4, pp. 1723-1732, (2021); Sajjad, Muhammad, Raspberry Pi assisted face recognition framework for enhanced law-enforcement services in smart cities, Future Generation Computer Systems, 108, pp. 995-1007, (2020); Mohanty, Saraju P., Everything you wanted to know about smart cities, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, 5, 3, pp. 60-70, (2016); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2011)","Y.

A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4–15 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations. We show that in countries with a high number of post-war neighbourhoods in well-connected locations, considerable densification opportunities could be realised in already built-up residential areas. © 2021 The Author(s)",Archetype; Compact city; Machine learning; Redensification; Urban design; Urban structure unit,Housing; Learning systems; Archetype; Compact city; Densifications; Geo-spatial; Machine-learning; Redensification; Urban design; Urban neighborhood; Urban structure unit; Densification; computer simulation; machine learning; neighborhood; post-war; spatial analysis; urban design; urbanization; Switzerland,,,,,"Bundesamt für Energie, UFE, (SI/501894-01)",This work is supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy under the project StaVerdi (SI/501894-01) .

The satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD), which could represent the concentration of atmospheric particles to a certain extent, is widely used for estimating ambient PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration, in combination with diverse auxiliary information. However, the general satellite-derived PM<inf>2.5</inf> products exhibit limitation in the application and aggregate analysis of PM<inf>2.5</inf> in urban areas, because of the moderate spatial resolution to match the urban landscape and low spatial coverage making it hard to describe airmass trajectory. In order to explore the potential application value of PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration products with relatively high spatial coverage and resolution, a two-stage machine learning and geo-statistics coupled model incorporating with a feedback mechanism was proposed in this study. To be specific, we firstly develop a hybrid back-propagation neural network coupled kriging with external drifting approach (BPNN-KED) for estimating 1-km daily PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration maps at high coverage over four urban agglomerations in China. The model performs well, with R2 up to 0.83 and root mean square error of 14.7 μg/m3 from cross-validation. The daily PM<inf>2.5</inf> maps display an average spatial coverage exceeding 95%, and on an average, each grid produces 350 days of valid estimations annually. In addition, the extra value of the high-coverage PM<inf>2.5</inf> estimates were explored through the more accurate aggregate analysis of urban PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution level. The advantage of the high-coverage PM<inf>2.5</inf> estimation is demonstrated through daily PM<inf>2.5</inf> hotspot identification over urban areas, providing substantially fine spatially resolved PM<inf>2.5</inf> trends, which offers the potential for daily pollutant emission sources location through satellite remote sensing technology. Moreover, the spatiotemporally continuous PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations possess the ability to capture polluted air mass trajectories, thereby offering observational support not only for evaluating the contribution from exogenous pollutants to local PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations and but also for providing empirical references for haze warning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",1-km resolution; Back-propagation neural network; High-coverage; Kriging with external drifting; PM2.5; Urban agglomerations,Aggregates; Backpropagation; Interpolation; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Remote sensing; Satellites; 1-km resolution; Aggregate analysis; Backpropagation neural networks; High-coverage; Kriging; Kriging with external drifting; PM$-2.5$; Spatial coverage; Urban agglomerations; Urban areas; Agglomeration; aerosol composition; ambient air; artificial neural network; back propagation; concentration (composition); estimation method; haze; kriging; optical depth; particulate matter; urban atmosphere; China,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42071353); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFC0212600)","This study was supported financially by the National Key R&D Program of China (Nos. 2017YFC0212600 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42071353 ).

This study proposes an AI and human co-operative evaluation (AIHCE) framework that facilitates communication design between designers and stakeholders based on human emotions and values and is an evaluation method for street space. AIHCE is an evaluation method based on image recognition technology that performs deep learning of the facial expressions of both people and the city; namely, it consists of a facial expression recognition model (FERM) and a street image evaluation model (SIEM). The former evaluates the street space based on the emotions and values of the pedestrian’s facial expression, and the latter evaluates the target street space from the prepared street space image. AIHCE is an integrated framework for these two models, enabling continuous and objective evaluation of space with simultaneous subjective emotional evaluation, showing the possibility of reflecting it in the design. It is expected to contribute to fostering people’s awareness that streets are public goods reflecting the basic functions of public spaces and the values and regional characteristics of residents, contributing to the improvement of the sustainability of the entire city. © 2021 by the authors.

While roadside vegetation barriers can help mitigate TRAP, their effectiveness to reduce TRAP is influenced by site-specific conditions. To test vegetation designs using direct field measurements or high-fidelity numerical simulations is often infeasible since urban planners and local communities often lack the access and expertise to use those tools. There is a need for a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use method to evaluate vegetation barrier designs based on their capacity to mitigate TRAP. In this paper, we investigated five machine learning (ML) methods, including linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and neural networks (NN), to predict size-resolved and locationally dependent particle concentrations downwind of various vegetation barrier designs. Data from 83 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations was used to train and test the ML models. We developed downwind region-specific models to capture the complexity of this problem and enhance the overall accuracy. Our feature space was composed of variables that can be feasibly obtained such as vegetation width, height, leaf area index (LAI), particle size, leaf area density (LAD) and wind speed at different heights. RF, NN, and XGB performed well with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 6–7% and an average test R2 value >0.91, while SVM and LR had an NRMSE of approximately 13% and an average test R2 value of 0.56. Using feature selection, vegetation dimensions and particle size had the highest influence in predicting pollutant concentrations. The ML models developed can help create tools to aid local communities in developing mitigation strategies to address TRAP problems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Air quality; Green infrastructure; Machine learning; Particulate matter (PM); Urban designs; Vegetation,Air pollution; Computational fluid dynamics; Decision trees; Mean square error; Particle size; Roadsides; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Vegetation; Wind; Adverse health effects; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Green infrastructure; Mitigation strategy; Particle concentrations; Pollutant concentration; Root mean square errors; Traffic-related air pollution; Learning systems; accuracy assessment; air quality; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; design; greenspace; infrastructural development; machine learning; numerical model; traffic emission; urban design; vegetation cover; air pollution; article; artificial neural network; computational fluid dynamics; feature selection; leaf area; linear regression analysis; particle size; particulate matter; pollutant; random forest; simulation; support vector machine; vegetation; wind speed,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1605407)",The authors acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through grant no. 1605407 .,"Abhijith, K.

Urban morphological feature extraction and similarity analysis represents a practical framework in many studies to interpret and introduce the current built environment to aid in proposing novel designs. In conventional methods, morphological features are represented based on qualitative descriptions, symbolical interpretation, or manually selected indicators. However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach. We constructed a dataset of 3817 residential plots with geometrical and related infrastructure information. A deep convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet, was implemented with the plots’ figure–ground images, by quantifying the morphological features into 2048-dimensional feature vectors. We conducted a similarity analysis of the plots by calculating the Euclidean distance between the high-dimensional feature vectors. Then, a comparison study was performed by retrieving cases based on the plot shape and plots with buildings separately. The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences. This work could serve as a basis for further typo-morphology studies and other morphology-related ecological, social, and economic studies for sustainable built environments. © 2021 by the authors.

Hyperspectral data are increasingly being considered for exploring levels of urbanization, due to their capability to capture the spectral variability that a modern urban landscape offers. Data and algorithms are two sides of a coin: while the data capture the variations, the algorithms provide suitable methods to extract relevant information. The literature reports a variety of algorithms for extraction of urban information from any given data, with varying accuracies. This article aims to explore the binary-classifier approach to target detection to extract certain features. Roads and roofs are the most common features present in any urban scene. These experiments were conducted on a subset of AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data from the Udaipur region of India, with roads and roofs as targets. Four categories of target-detection algorithms are identified from a literature survey and our previous experience—distance measures, angle-based measures, information measures, and machinelearning measures—followed by performance evaluation. The article also presents a brief taxonomy of algorithms; explores methods such as the Mahalanobis angle, which has been reported to be effective for extraction of urban targets; and explores newer machine-learning algorithms to increase accuracy.

Soil erosion threatens the functioning of urban areas, which was the reason for choosing the territory of the Master Plan of Belgrade (Serbia) as the research area. The calculation of soil erosion loss was analyzed using the G2 erosion model. The model belongs to a group of empirical models and is based on the synthesis of the equation from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Erosion Potential Method (EPM). The estimation of soil degradation was analyzed in two time periods (2001 and 2019), which represent the time boundaries of the management of the Master Plan of Belgrade. The novel approach used in this research is based on using the land cover inventory as a dynamic indicator of the urbanization process. Land cover was identified using remote sensing, machine learning techniques, and the random forest algorithm applied to multispectral satellite images of the Landsat mission in combination with spectral indices. Climatic parameters were analyzed on the basis of data from meteorological stations (first scenario, i.e., 2001), as well as on simulations of changes based on climate scenario RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathways) concerning the current condition of the land cover (second scenario). A comparative analysis of the two time periods identified a slight reduction in total soil loss. For the first period, the average soil loss value is 4.11 t·ha-1·y-1. The analysis of the second period revealed an average value of 3.63 t·ha-1·y-1. However, the increase in non-porous surfaces has led to a change in the focus of soil degradation. Increased average soil loss as one of the catalysts of torrential flood frequencies registered on natural and semi-natural areas were 43.29% and 16.14%, respectively. These results are a significant contribution to the study of soil erosion in urban conditions under the impact of climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

Such analysis becomes challenging for urban networks as their size and complexity are significantly higher compared to other networks. The state-of-the-art machine learning techniques allow us to detect hidden patterns and, thus, infer the features associated with them. However, very little is known about the impact on the performance of such predictive models by the use of different input representations. In this paper, we design and evaluate six different graph input representations (i.e. representations of the network paths), by considering the network’s topological and temporal characteristics, for being used as inputs for machine learning models to learn the behavior of urban network paths. The representations are validated and then tested with a real-world taxi journeys dataset predicting the tips of using a road network of New York. Our results demonstrate that the input representations that use temporal information help the model to achieve the highest accuracy (root mean-squared error of 1.42$). © The Author(s) 2019.",graph learning; path representation; Urban networks,complexity; machine learning; network analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban design; urban development; urban planning; New York [United States]; United States,,,,,"University College London, UCL; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/L006340/1, EP/P016278/1); Alan Turing Institute, (EP/N510129/1)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported through the EPSRC Grants EP/L006340/1 and EP/P016278/1 at UCL and by The Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC Grant EP/N510129/1.","Managing and Mining Graph Data, (2010); Network Flows Theory Algorithms and Applications, (2017); Arun, K., A survey on network path identification using bio inspired algorithms, pp. 387-389, (2016); Bengio, Yoshua, Representation learning: A review and new perspectives, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35, 8, pp. 1798-1828, (2013); Graph Theory with Applications, (1976); undefined, (2016); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, (1958); Applying Graph Theory in Ecological Research, (2017); Graph Theory Graduate Texts in Mathematics, (2005); Dijkstra, E.

And yet, we cannot disregard the most vulnerable elements in the urban landscape: pedestrians, exposed to higher risks than other road users. Indeed, safe, accessible, and sustainable transport systems in cities are a core target of the UN's 2030 Agenda. Thus, there is an opportunity to apply advanced computational tools to the problem of traffic safety, in regards especially to pedestrians, who have been often overlooked in the past. This paper combines public data sources, large-scale street imagery and computer vision techniques to approach pedestrian and vehicle safety with an automated, relatively simple, and universally-applicable data-processing scheme. The steps involved in this pipeline include the adaptation and training of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network to determine a hazard index for each given urban scene, as well as an interpretability analysis based on image segmentation and class activation mapping on those same images. Combined, the outcome of this computational approach is a fine-grained map of hazard levels across a city, and an heuristic to identify interventions that might simultaneously improve pedestrian and vehicle safety.

In this research, we developed a method based on semantic segmentation processing of street view images to calculate the Green View Index of urban streets, and the Panoramic View Green View Index (PVGVI) is proposed for measuring the visible street-level greenery.

This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Change detection index; LST; NDBI; NDVI; Urban heat island; Urban planning,Cell proliferation; Cluster analysis; Decision making; Economic and social effects; K-means clustering; Land surface temperature; Process monitoring; Surface properties; Vegetation; Change detection; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized differences; Spatial analysis; Surface temperatures; Temperature increase; Urban surface temperature; Vegetation cover; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; detection method; heat island; land surface; Landsat; NDVI; surface temperature; urban atmosphere; urban planning; urbanization; Penedono; Portugal; Viseu [Portugal],,,,,"Lowe Syndrome Trust, LST","For an intra-urban scale evaluation, samples from each group were detailed based on high-resolution images, NDVI, NDBI, LST, and CDI changes.

By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Active travel; Deep learning; GIS; Heat vulnerability index (HVI); Sky view factor (SVF); Tree shade,Deep learning; Forestry; Land use; Planning; Population statistics; Adaptation strategies; Geographical area; Health benefits; Learning models; Panorama images; Planning and design; Social-economic; Thermal environment; Sustainable development; comparative study; GIS; heat flow; neighborhood; policy making; satellite imagery; shade tolerance; spatial data; temperature effect; urban design; urban planning; vulnerability; air temperature; Article; canopy; city planning; climate change; controlled study; deep learning; environmental policy; health impact assessment; heat stress; heat tolerance; heat wave; humidity; image segmentation; metabolic rate; physical activity; population density; priority journal; shade; social status; solar radiation; summer; thermal exposure; thermography; travel; urban area; urbanization; Victoria; wind speed; winter,,,,,(SCS59435),"Funding text 1: This research was funded by Australian Smart Cities and Suburbs Program-Smart Active Transport—Urban Heat Maps for Bendigo (SCS59435) and the Clean Air and Urban Landscape Hub funded by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program.

The book covers events ranging from Banksy art installations, mobile food trucks, and underground restaurants, to a Black Lives Matter protest, the Christchurch mosque shootings, and the Pulse nightclub shooting. The interplay between urban space, local community, and social media in each case study requires diverse methodologies that are both computational (i.e. machine learning, social network analysis, and natural language processing) and ethnographic (i.e. semi-structured interviews, thematic analysis, and site analysis). The book views social media not as a replacement for the local community or urban space but rather as a translation of the uses and meanings of all three realms.

Although there is much evidence that innovative technology is crucial to fight the Covid-19, the analysis of the literature highlights the poor attention paid in the study of the urban governance framework based on emerging technologies during the pandemic. Based on these considerations, the work aims to propose a decision-making support model for the urban local governments.

In this study, we objectively measured the seemingly subjective qualities of the eye-level urban landscape perceptions with computer vision and machine learning technologies. We then explored correlations between the measured perceptual qualities and characteristics from the historical context. We chose Berlin as a research object because it is a capital city that owns a rich history of division and reunification, as well as a variety of residential zones built at different periods. We extracted 30 street features from the 150,000 Google Street View Imagery (SVI) dataset with a computer vision algorithm and evaluated eight perceptual qualities including typology, order, ecology, enclosure, aesthetics, richness, accessibility and scale with a machine learning method. Then we defined seven residential districts in Berlin, according to their spatial distributions and construction periods. Through a systematic comparison of perceptual qualities of the seven residential districts, we find perceptual qualities of ecology and enclosure have been improved a lot over a hundred years in Berlin. The housing policies and design codes in different social, economic and political contexts evolved to end overcrowding living conditions, create more open spaces, and develop a better ecological environment. This study enriches our understanding and application of subjective measures of human-centred built environment perception to the evolution of the historical urban landscape. The proposed quantitative framework of subjective human perception measures provides great testimony to evaluate the effects of the implementation of housing and other urban planning policies. Such an automated, multisource, high-throughput and scalable framework can be applied to other cities to determine the personality of the city and assess the impact of urban design and planning policies in streetscape improvement. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH ·.",Computer vision; Google street view image; Machine learning; Perceptual qualities,,,,,,,,"undefined; undefined; Arnold, John David Mc Ewen, Creating a longitudinal, data-driven 3D model of change over time in a postindustrial landscape using GIS and CityEngine, Journal of Cultural Heritage Management and Sustainable Development, 8, 4, pp. 434-447, (2018); Bernet, Claus, The 'Hobrecht plan' (1862) and Berlin's urban structure, Urban History, 31, 3, pp. 400-419, (2004); Bentlin, Felix, Understanding the Hobrecht Plan.

The author asks: what informational cues are encoded in the urban landscape and activated through embodied practices of wayfinding? To explore this question of street-level wayfinding, the author utilizes the exploratory method of arts-based research, focusing on the act of giving directions, both spoken and drawn, and developing the research in four unique cities: Amsterdam, London, New York, and Toronto. Analysis of the data uses visual grounded theory and situational analysis. Based on the findings, the author classifies three types of urban forms that helped guide navigation during these wayfinding encounters: pathways, transmitters, and markings. In unpacking the variants within these registers of spatial sense-making, the author identifies informational elements of the city present in its material and built environment but also in its social and tacit forms. The paper offers a framework to look at the multiplicities of information, structured and embodied, that guide wayfinding, situated beyond (but co-existent with) mobile mapping tools. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Arts-based methods; Embodied information practices; Urban wayfinding,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Built environment; Grounded theory; Information practices; Locative media; Mobile mapping; Spatial sense; Urban landscape; Way-finding; Mapping,,,,,,,"Old Ways A Journey on Foot, (2012); Lloyd, Annemaree, Chasing Frankenstein’s monster: information literacy in the black box society, Journal of Documentation, 75, 6, pp. 1475-1485, (2019); Platform Urbanism Negotiating Platform Ecosystems in Connected Cities, (2020); Deep Mapping the Media City, (2015); Visual Research Methods an Introduction for Library and Information Studies, (2020); Lloyd, Annemaree, Information literacy and literacies of information: A mid-range theory and model, Journal of Information Literacy, 11, 1, pp. 91-105, (2017); Lloyd, Annemaree, Researching fractured (information) landscapes: Implications for library and information science researchers undertaking research with refugees and forced migration studies, Journal of Documentation, 73, 1, pp. 35-47, (2017); Image of the City, (1960); Information Research, (2008); Mandel, Lauren Heather, Understanding and describing users’ wayfinding behavior in public library facilities, Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 50, 1, pp. 23-33, (2018)","R.

This may indicate average variation in plant growth over large urban landscape (community gardens, green corridor etc). Towards this direction, this short technical note explores development of a simple automated machine learning program that can accurately segregate colors from plant leaves. In this newly developed program, a machine learning algorithm has been modified and adapted to give the proportion of different colors present in a leaf. Python script is developed for an image processing. For validation, experiments are conducted in green house to grow Axonopus compressus. Script first extracts different RGB (Red Green and Blue) colors present in the leaf using the K-means clustering algorithm. Appropriate centroids required for the clusters of leaf colors are formed by the K-means algorithm. The new program provides saves computation time and gives output in form of different colors proportion as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. This study is the first step towards the demonstration of using automated programs for the segregation of colors from the leaf in order to access the growth of the plant in an urban landscape. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",Data-informed urban design; Greenway planning; Machine learning algorithms; Multi-sourced urban data,anthropogenic effect; data set; detection method; GIS; greenspace; integrated approach; machine learning; species diversity; strategic approach; urban design; urban ecosystem; urban planning; China; Guangdong; Maoming,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (20ZR1462200); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51708410, 52078343); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (2020010102); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Tongji University","We would like to express our appreciation for the editor and three anonymous reviewers for the time and effort you have taken to provide such insightful guidance.

Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; Smart city; Social media data; Urban landscape sustainability; Urban planning,Behavioral research; Big data; Deep learning; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Land use; Quality control; Security of data; Sustainable development; Tourism; Urban planning; Application fields; Data security and privacy; Environmental sustainability; Information mining; Real-time information; Urban applications; Urban environments; Urban sustainability; Information management,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41871185, 41971271); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2014CB954303, 2019QZKK0405, 2019YFA0607203); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFA0607203), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program of China (2019QZKK0405), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41871185&41971271), and the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954303).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFA0607203 ), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program of China ( 2019QZKK0405 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41871185&41971271 ), and the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2014CB954303 ).","Agapiou, A., Remote sensing heritage in a petabyte-scale: satellite data and heritage Earth Engine© applications, International Journal of Digital Earth, 10, 1, pp. 85-102, (2017); Agrawal, Rakesh, Mining Association Rules Between Sets of Items in Large Databases, SIGMOD Record, 22, 2, pp. 207-216, (1993); Al Nuaimi, Eiman, Applications of big data to smart cities, Journal of Internet Services and Applications, 6, 1, pp. 1-15, (2015); Allam, Zaheer, On big data, artificial intelligence and smart cities, Cities, 89, pp. 80-91, (2019); Bassolas, Aleix, Hierarchical organization of urban mobility and its connection with city livability, Nature Communications, 10, 1, (2019); Batty, Michael J., Big data, smart cities and city planning, Dialogues in Human Geography, 3, 3, pp. 274-279, (2013); Becker, Richard A., A tale of one city: Using cellular network data for urban planning, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 10, 4, pp. 18-26, (2011); Bergen, Karianne J., Machine learning for data-driven discovery in solid Earth geoscience, Science, 363, 6433, (2019); Importance of Big Data A Definition, (2012); Boeing, Geoff, New Insights into Rental Housing Markets across the United States: Web Scraping and Analyzing Craigslist Rental Listings, Journal of Planning Education and Research, 37, 4, pp. 457-476, (2017)","Z.

Notably, the urban heat island phenomenon is becoming more prominent in megacities and their hinterlands in temperate and subtropical climatic regions. In the daytime in summer, there exists a high possibility of accelerating the land surface temperature (LST) in desert cities, due to the alterations made by human beings in the natural environment. In this study, we investigate the spatial formation of LST in a tropical sub-Saharan city of Accra, a gateway to West Africa, using Landsat data in 2003 and 2017. Machine learning techniques and the different spatial and statistical methods such as tasseled cap transformation (TCT), urban-rural gradient, and multiresolution grid-based and landscape metrics were employed to examine procured land use/cover (LUC) and LST maps. LUC was classified into five categories: Built up, Green 1, Green 2, Bare land, and Water. The results of the analysis indicate that Built up, Green 2, and Bare land had caused the highest heating effect while Green 1 and Water had caused the considerable cooling effect during the daytime in Accra. The urban-rural difference in LST recorded 1.4 °C in 2003 and 0.28 °C in 2017. The mean size, mean shape, largest patch, and aggregation of Built up, Green 1, and Green 2 had a strong relationship with the mean LST. It is essential for urban planners to carefully examine the formation and effect of the urban heat island (UHI) for sustainable urban development and landscape policy toward mitigation and adaptation planning in Accra. © 2020 by the authors.",Accra; Land surface temperature; Sustainable cities; Tasseled cap transformation; Urban heat island; Urban landscape pattern,cooling; heat island; land cover; land use change; Landsat; satellite data; spatial analysis; twenty first century; urban development; urbanization; Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (18H00763, 2018-20)",Funding: This study was partly supported by the JSPS grant 18H00763 (2018-20).,"Estoque, Ronald C., Quantifying landscape pattern and ecosystem service value changes in four rapidly urbanizing hill stations of Southeast Asia, Landscape Ecology, 31, 7, pp. 1481-1507, (2016); Zhang, Dan, Study on sustainable urbanization literature based on Web of Science, scopus, and China national knowledge infrastructure: A scientometric analysis in CiteSpace, Journal of Cleaner Production, 264, (2020); Michishita, Ryo, Monitoring two decades of urbanization in the Poyang Lake area, China through spectral unmixing, Remote Sensing of Environment, 117, pp. 3-18, (2012); Weber, Christiane H., Urbanization pressure and modeling of urban growth: Example of the Tunis Metropolitan Area, Remote Sensing of Environment, 86, 3, pp. 341-352, (2003); Franco, Sainu, Urbanization, energy consumption and emissions in the Indian context A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 71, pp. 898-907, (2017); Cao, Hongbin, Urbanization-related changes in soil PAHs and potential health risks of emission sources in a township in Southern Jiangsu, China, Science of the Total Environment, 575, pp. 692-700, (2017); Shahbaz, Muhammad, Economic growth, electricity consumption, urbanization and environmental degradation relationship in United Arab Emirates, Ecological Indicators, 45, pp. 622-631, (2014); Al-Mulali, Usama, The effect of energy consumption, urbanization, trade openness, industrial output, and the political stability on the environmental degradation in the MENA (Middle East and North African) region, Energy, 84, pp. 382-389, (2015); Wang, Yuanyuan, Temporal and spatial variation relationship and influence factors on surface urban heat island and ozone pollution in the Yangtze River Delta, China, Science of the Total Environment, 631-632, pp. 921-933, (2018); Climate of London, (1818)","D.

This research aims to discern the success of sustainability planning by examining and comparing the different characteristics of UHIs through the combination of machine learning and statistical methods. To achieve this, we analyze 4 new towns in Korea, which include two ‘old’ new towns and two ‘recent’ new towns. The key difference between our test towns lies on whether or not the sustainability policies were applied to their development plans. We visualize LST and conduct a k-mean clustering to find and quantify spatial patterning in the resulting UHI measures. We then compare the statistical relations between LST and 6 UHI driven variables across the towns. Using comparative analysis, this research reveals that sustainable development policies have a notable effect on the patterns and intensities of UHI. Urban structures, planned under development policies, including green and blue space ratios, road networks, and housing distributions, were found to affect UHI significantly. We quantifiably confirm that the sustainability policies implemented in planning the ‘recent’ new towns allow the towns to experience less aggravated UHIs than the ‘old’ new towns. However, we also claim a need to develop appropriate, long-term UHI management regulations for the ‘recent’ new towns.

This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity.

It is of great significance to ensure the user comfort while controlling the growth of building energy use. Accurate quantification of urban buildings' energy demand can support energy efficient and sustainable community design, assist urban morphology generation and optimization, building layout optimization, building shape and construction design, HVAC system optimization, assessment of the energy program and policy. In recent years, researchers worldwide have carried out research of urban scale energy consumption calculation methods from different perspectives, and encountered different technical difficulties. This paper provides a critical review on the energy modeling methods at urban neighborhood scale from the following three aspects: database, models and platforms. Through literature review, the authors indicate the advantages and limitations of current urban building energy calculation methods and tools, and propose the following possible approaches to improve the operational energy consumption calculation method for urban buildings: (1) develop micro-environment data generation methods that can be directly applied to energy consumption calculation of urban buildings; (2) improve the capabilities to collect, filter and convert the building information data by introducing the data mining technique; (3) introduce the cluster analysis and artificial intelligence technology to improve the speed of energy consumption calculation; (4) develop a visualization platform to realize real-time editing and calculating of urban design. © 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",building dataset; energy model; energy modelling platform; operational energy consumption; urban buildings,Architectural design; Climate control; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Data visualization; Energy utilization; Filtration; Urban planning; Accurate quantifications; Artificial intelligence technologies; Building energy use; Economic and social development; Sustainable communities; Technical difficulties; Urban-Scale Energy Consumption; Visualization platforms; Energy efficiency,,,,,"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2019M650408); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFE010332); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This research is supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (No. 2019M650408), and the National Key Research and Development Project (2019YFE010332)","Allegrini, Jonas, Influence of the urban microclimate in street canyons on the energy demand for space cooling and heating of buildings, Energy and Buildings, 55, pp. 823-832, (2012); Arayici, Yusuf, An approach for real world data modelling with the 3D terrestrial laser scanner for built environment, Automation in Construction, 16, 6, pp. 816-829, (2007); Ascione, Fabrizio, Analysis and diagnosis of the energy performance of buildings and districts: Methodology, validation and development of Urban Energy Maps, Cities, 35, pp. 270-283, (2013); International Journal of 3 D Information Modeling Ij3dim, (2014); Bueno, Bruno, A resistance-capacitance network model for the analysis of the interactions between the energy performance of buildings and the urban climate, Building and Environment, 54, pp. 116-125, (2012); Bueno, Bruno, Computationally efficient prediction of canopy level urban air temperature at the neighbourhood scale, Urban Climate, 9, pp. 35-53, (2014); Fundamentals of Building Energy Dynamics, (1996); Calcerano, Filippo, Numerical optimisation through dynamic simulation of the position of trees around a stand-alone building to reduce cooling energy consumption, Energy and Buildings, 112, pp. 234-243, (2016); Caputo, Paola, A supporting method for defining energy strategies in the building sector at urban scale, Energy Policy, 55, pp. 261-270, (2013); Chen, Yixing, Automatic generation and simulation of urban building energy models based on city datasets for city-scale building retrofit analysis, Applied Energy, 205, pp. 323-335, (2017)","J.

In this area, it is impacted by the fungal pathogen Diplodia sapinea, which causes a tip blight and canker on infected trees. While the disease can be managed through the application of fungicides and/or by preventing environmental conditions that are favorable for the pathogen, these practices only temporarily alleviate the problem. A more sustainable solution is to use resistant trees. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric analysis can distinguish between trees that vary in susceptibility to D. sapinea. Trees were phenotyped for resistance to D. sapinea by artificially inoculating shoots and measuring ensuing lesions seven days following inoculation. Then, three different chemometric approaches, including a type of machine learning called support vector machine (SVM), were used to evaluate whether or not trees that varied in susceptibility could be distinguished. Trees that varied in susceptibility could be discriminated based on FT-IR spectra collected prior to pathogen infection using the three chemometric approaches: soft independent modeling of class analogy, partial least squares regression, and SVM. While further validation of the predictive models is needed, the results suggest that the approach may be useful as a tool for screening and breeding Austrian pine for resistance to D. sapinea. Furthermore, this approach may have wide applicability in other tree/plant pathosystems of concern and economic value to the nursery and ornamental industries. © 2020 International Society of Arboriculture",Diplodia sapinea; Diplodia tip blight; FT-IR; Pinus nigra; Predictive modeling,computer simulation; forest management; FTIR spectroscopy; fungal disease; machine learning; model validation; pathogen; phenotype; pine; Midwest; United States,,,,,,,"Abdel-Rahman, Elfatih Mohamed, Detecting Sirex noctilio grey-attacked and lightning-struck pine trees using airborne hyperspectral data, random forest and support vector machines classifiers, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 88, pp. 48-59, (2014); Barnes, Ralph J., Standard normal variate transformation and de-trending of near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectra, Applied Spectroscopy, 43, 5, pp. 772-777, (1989); Blodgett, James T., Effects of moderate water stress on disease development by Sphaeropsis sapinea on red pine, Phytopathology, 87, 4, pp. 422-428, (1997); Blodgett, James T., Sphaeropsis sapinea and water stress in a red pine plantation in Central Wisconsin, Phytopathology, 87, 4, pp. 429-434, (1997); I.

The use of these typologies and finding similarities and dissimilarities between cities enables better targeted interventions for improved health, transport, and environmental outcomes in urban areas. A better understanding of local contexts can also assist in applying lessons learned from other cities. Constructing urban typologies at a global scale through traditional methods, such as functional or network analysis, requires the collection of data across multiple political districts, which can be inconsistent and then require a level of subjective classification. To overcome these limitations, we use neural networks to analyse millions of images of urban form (consisting of street view, satellite imagery, and street maps) to find shared characteristics between the largest 1692 cities in the world. The comparison city of Paris is used as an exemplar and we perform a case study using two Australian cities, Melbourne and Sydney, to determine if a “Paris-end” of town exists or can be found in these cities using these three big data imagery sets. The results show specific advantages and disadvantages of each type of imagery in constructing urban typologies. Neural networks trained with map imagery will be highly influenced by the structural mix of roads, public transport, and green and blue space. Satellite imagery captures a combination of both urban form and decorative and natural details. The use of street view imagery emphasises the features of a human-scaled visual geography of streetscapes. However, for both satellite and street view imagery to be highly effective, a reduction in scale and more aggressive pre-processing might be required in order to reduce detail and create greater abstraction in the imagery. © 2020 by the authors.",health; machine learning; transport; urban design; urban typology,,,,,,"National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (APP1136250); University of Melbourne, UNIMELB","This project was made possible thanks to computer hardware purchased by the Transportation, Health, and Urban Design (THUD) Research Lab at the University of Melbourne.

Therefore, the employment of generative design solutions becomes more and more an indispensable part in the production pipeline of architecture and space. However various barriers prevent the integration of such tools in early design stages, including the lack of design practice studies, domain expertise and commonly time-consuming and disintegrated simulation engines. In our study we demonstrate a method and workflow on how the interoperability and computational cost barriers can be reduced, using an integrated simulation and analysis approach based on machine learning and generative design. We illustrate our approach by optimizing the spatial configuration of a hypothetical, medium sized urban design project in the city of Vienna for a diverse set of fitness objectives.

In this study, adaptive hierarchical image segmentation optimization, multilevel feature selection, and multiscale (MS) supervised machine learning (ML) models were integrated to accurately generate detailed maps for heterogeneous urban areas from the fusion of the UHSR orthomosaic and digital surface model (DSM). The integrated approach commenced through a preliminary MS image segmentation parameter selection, followed by the application of three supervised ML models, namely, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT). These models were implemented at the optimal MS levels to identify preliminary information, such as the optimal segmentation level(s) and relevant features, for extracting 12 land use/land cover (LULC) urban classes from the fused datasets. Using the information obtained from the first phase of the analysis, detailed MS classification was iteratively conducted to improve the classification accuracy and derive the final urban LULC maps. Two UAV-based datasets were used to develop and assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The hierarchical classification of the pilot study area showed that the RF was superior with an overall accuracy (OA) of 94.40% and a kappa coefficient (K) of 0.938, followed by SVM (OA = 92.50% and K = 0.917) and DT (OA = 91.60% and K = 0.908).

Several diseases such as asthma and cardiovascular conditions are becoming more diffuse, due to a rise in pollution exposure and a more sedentary lifestyle. Healthcare providers deal with increasing new challenges, and thanks to fast-developing big data technologies, they can be faced with systems that provide direct support to citizens. In this context, within the EU-funded Participatory Urban Living for Sustainable Environments (PULSE) project, we are implementing a data analytic platform designed to provide public health decision makers with advanced approaches, to jointly analyze maps and geospatial information with healthcare and air pollution data. In this paper we describe a component of such platforms, which couples deep learning analysis of urban geospatial images with healthcare indexes collected by the 500 Cities project. By applying a pre-learned deep Neural Network architecture, satellite images of New York City are analyzed and latent feature variables are extracted. These features are used to derive clusters, which are correlated with healthcare indicators by means of a multivariate classification model. Thanks to this pipeline, it is possible to show that, in New York City, health care indexes are significantly correlated to the urban landscape. This pipeline can serve as a basis to ease urban planning, since the same interventions can be organized on similar areas, even if geographically distant. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, a computational model consisting of a drying-cycle model and wetting-cycle model was developed by means of a genetic programming method to depict variations in soil suction using select influential parameters. The input data in the model development were measured in a field monitoring test on the campus of the University of Macau. Soil suction was quantified by field monitoring at different distances (0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 3.0 m) from a tree, at a constant depth of 20 cm, with selected influential parameters including initial soil suction, air humidity, rainfall amount, cycle duration, and ratio of distance from tree to tree canopy. Based on the performance analysis, the efficiency and reliability of the proposed computational model are validated. The importance of each input and the coupled effect of each two input variables on the output were investigated using global sensitivity analysis. It can be concluded that the proposed computational model based on the artificial intelligence simulation method describes the relationship between field soil suction in drying–wetting cycles and select input variables within an acceptable degree of error. Accordingly, it can serve as a tool for supporting geotechnical construction design and for assessing the safety and risk of geotechnical green infrastructures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Drying cycle; Genetic programming; Global sensitivity analysis; Performance analysis; Soil suction; Wetting cycle,Computation theory; Computational methods; Drying; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Plants (botany); Reliability analysis; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Sensitivity analysis; Wetting; Drying cycle; Global sensitivity analysis; Performance analysis; Soil suction; Wetting cycles; Soils; artificial intelligence; genetic algorithm; monitoring; performance assessment; sensitivity analysis; soil mechanics; suction; tree; wetting-drying cycle,,,,,"Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF, (193/2017/A3, SKL-IOTSC-2018-2020); Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF; Universidade de Macau, UM, (MYRG2017-00198-FST, MYRG2018-00173-FST); Universidade de Macau, UM","The authors would like to acknowledge the support founded by The Science and Technology Development Fund , Macau SAR (File no.

However, as a high-density city, Macau’s limited urban space must cope with the growing population and the arrival of an aging society. In the existing studies, less attention has been paid to Macau, especially the relationship between Macanese elderly and urban space. This study uses Baidu Street View (BSV) on the Macau Peninsula and conducts field surveys to obtain street view data to evaluate the openness, greenness, interface coverage, and road area ratio of street space and its association with the physical and mental health of the elderly and social health. The results show that the data truly reflect the overall street space conditions on the Macau Peninsula. The street openness, greenery rate, and interface enclosure are all related to the elderly in various evaluations in areas with a higher population dependency index and aging index. Human space perception is related to health gain, and road area ratio is weaker than other indicators. The research results have certain policy implications and have practical significance for city managers and designers. © 2020 by the authors.

Radar imagery, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, can penetrate clouds and provide opportunities for water body identification when in situ observations are difficult to obtain because of severe weather conditions. However, when using SAR images in urban areas to extract water bodies, the radar's double-bounce effect results in complicated backscatter patterns of water near urban features such as buildings due to the side-looking properties of SAR sensors and the vertical urban structures. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a reliable urban water extraction framework for SAR images that integrates urban surface morphological features for controlling radar's multiple bounces. Statistical (logistic regression) and machine-learning (random forest) models were used to explore how radar's double-bounce effect influences the prediction performance of urban water extraction. Our findings indicate that when extracting urban water bodies, urban water's backscatter values could be significantly interfered by the neighboring building density above a threshold height that contributes to radar's multiple bounces. Without model calibration, our framework incorporating urban surface morphology demonstrates high prediction ability with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.914 and with 97.0% of urban water cells correctly identified by testing in another city sharing similar urban forms. In summary, our study provides a better understanding of the role of the urban surface morphology in the double-bounce effect in SAR images, specifically for differentiating urban water and land, thereby improving the accuracy of urban water extraction and enhancing the feasibility of further applications of SAR imagery under complex urban landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Radar's double-bounce effect; Sentinel-1 satellites; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Urban morphology; Water body extraction,image analysis; image resolution; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; urban morphology; Satellites,,,,,"(NTU-107L9010); Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (108-2638-H-002-002-MY2); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; National Health Research Institutes, NHRI, (NHRI -108A1-MRCO-0619191); National Health Research Institutes, NHRI; National Taiwan University, NTU","Funding text 1: This research was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [ MOST 108-2638-H-002-002-MY2 ]; and the National Health Research Institutes [ NHRI -108A1-MRCO-0619191 ].

In the past few decades, methods adapted by scholars of analyzing the figure-ground relationship of university campuses have gradually turned from qualitative to quantitative. And with the widespread application of AI technology in various disciplines, emerging research tools such as machine learning/deep learning have also been used in the study of urban morphology. On this basis, this paper reports on a potential application of deep clustering and big-data methods for campus morphological analysis. It documents a new framework for compressing the customized diagrammatic images containing a campus and its surrounding city context into integrated feature vectors via a convolutional autoencoder model, and using the compressed feature vectors for clustering and quantitative analysis of campus morphology. © Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

Previous research has found numerous correlations between the built environment and both physical and mental health outcomes-suggesting that the design of our cities may have significant impacts on human health. Developing methods of analysis that can provide insight on the correlations between the built environment and human health could help the allied design disciplines shape our cities in ways that promote human health. This research addresses these issues and contributes knowledge on the use of deep learning (DL) methods for urban analysis and mental health, specifically anxiety. Mental health disorders, such as anxiety, have been estimated to account for the largest proportion of global disease burden. The methods presented allow architects, planners, and urban designers to make use of large remote-sensing datasets (e.g.. satellite and aerial images) for design workflows involving analysis and generative design tasks. The research also contributes insight on correlations between anxiety prevalence and specific urban design features-providing actionable intelligence for the planning and design of the urban fabric. © Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

This process usually costs much time in the early design stage when the condition of a city has not been finally determined. Thus the designers spend a lot of time working forward and backward drawing sketches for different characteristics of cities. Meanwhile, machine learning, as a decision-making tool, has been widely used in many fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning, specially designed to learn and generate image data. Therefore, this research aims to apply GAN in creating urban design plans, helping designers automatically generate the predicted details of buildings configuration with a given condition of cities. Through the machine learning of image pairs, the result shows the relationship between the site conditions (roads, green lands, and rivers) and the configuration of buildings. This automatic design tool can help release the heavy load of urban designers in the early design stage, quickly providing a preview of design solutions for urban design tasks. The analysis of different machine learning models trained by the data from different cities inspires urban designers with design strategies and features in distinct conditions. © 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",Artificial intelligence; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Urban design,Decision making; Machine learning; Adversarial networks; Automatic design tools; Decision making tool; Design solutions; Design strategies; Early design stages; Forward-and-backward; Machine learning models; Architectural design,,,,,,,"Agarwal, Shankar, Painting galaxies into dark matter haloes using machine learning, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 478, 3, pp. 3410-3422, (2018); Cheng, Ching I., An intelligent clothes search system based on fashion styles, 3, pp. 1592-1597, (2008); Goodfellow, Ian J., Generative adversarial nets, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 3, January, pp. 2672-2680, (2014); Huang, Weixin, Architectural drawings recognition and generation through machine learning, pp. 156-165, (2018); Kim, Hee-su, Application of interactive genetic algorithm to fashion design, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 13, 6, pp. 635-644, (2000); Kvochick, Tyler, Sneaky spatial segmentation: Reading architectural drawings with deep neural networks and without labeling data, pp. 166-175, (2018); Mirabal, Néstor, 3Fgl demographics outside the galactic plane using supervised machine learning: pulsar and dark matter subhalo interpretations, Astrophysical Journal, 825, 1, (2016); Paganini, Michela, CaloGAN: Simulating 3D high energy particle showers in multilayer electromagnetic calorimeters with generative adversarial networks, Physical Review D, 97, 1, (2018); Proceedings of Caad Futures 2019, (2019); Wang, Tingchun, High-Resolution Image Synthesis and Semantic Manipulation with Conditional GANs, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 8798-8807, (2018)",,"Holzer, D.; Nakapan, W.; Globa, A.; Koh, I.",The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) i@caadria.org,,"25th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, CAADRIA 2020",2020-08-05 through 2020-08-06,Bangkok,162806,,9789887891741; 9789887891734,,,English,"RE: Anthr., Des.

In the current research on the urban environment, researchers use various methods to simulate and measure urban greenery. With the development of computer technology, the way to obtain data is more diverse. For the assessment of urban greenery quality, there are many methods, such as using remote sensing satellite images captured from above (antenna, space) sensors, to assess urban green coverage. However, this method is not suitable for the evaluation of street greenery. Unlike most remote sensing images, from a pedestrian perspective, urban street images are the most common view of green plants. The street view image presented by Google Street View image is similar to the captured by the pedestrian perspective. Thus it is more suitable for studying urban street greening. With the development of artificial intelligence, based on deep learning, we can abandon the heavy manual statistical work and obtain more accurate semantic information from street images. Furthermore, we can also measure green landscapes in larger areas of the city, as well as extract more details from street view images for urban research. © 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",Deep Learning; Google Street View; Green View Index; Segmentation,Antennas; Architectural design; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Semantics; Space optics; Computer technology; Remote sensing images; Remote sensing satellites; Semantic information; Statistical works; Urban environments; Urban landscape; Urban researches; Deep learning,,,,,,,"J Jpn Inst Landsc Archit, (1987); Environ Information Sci, (2006); Care of Trees in Lawn Street and Park, (1910); Urban Forests, (2017); Bowler, Diana E., Urban greening to cool towns and cities: A systematic review of the empirical evidence, Landscape and Urban Planning, 97, 3, pp. 147-155, (2010); Cao, Rui, Quantifying visual environment by semantic segmentation using deep learning, 2, pp. 623-632, (2019); Di, Suchuang, Urban green space classification and water consumption analysis with remote-sensing technology: a case study in Beijing, China, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 40, 5-6, pp. 1909-1929, (2019); Edwards, Nicole Joy, Development of a Public Open Space Desktop Auditing Tool (POSDAT): A remote sensing approach, Applied Geography, 38, 1, pp. 22-30, (2013); Gong, Fangying, Mapping sky, tree, and building view factors of street canyons in a high-density urban environment, Building and Environment, 134, pp. 155-167, (2018); Inoue, Kazuya, Tracking robustness and green view index estimation of augmented and diminished reality for environmental design: Photoar+dr2017 project, 1, pp. 339-348, (2018)",,"Holzer, D.; Nakapan, W.; Globa, A.; Koh, I.",The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) i@caadria.org,,"25th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, CAADRIA 2020",2020-08-05 through 2020-08-06,Bangkok,162806,,9789887891741; 9789887891734,,,English,"RE: Anthr., Des.

They also facilitate new methods of analyzing the built environment, ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to crowdsourced citizen participation. Digital representations of cities have become so refined that they challenge our perception of the real. However, computers have not yet become able to detect and analyze the visible features of built structures depicted in photographs or other media. Recent scientific advances mean that it is possible for this new field of computer vision to serve as a critical aid to research. Neural networks now meet the challenge of identifying and analyzing building elements, buildings and urban landscapes. The development and refinement of these technologies requires more attention, simultaneously, investigation is needed in regard to the use and meaning of these methods for historical research. For example, the use of AI raises questions about the ways in which computer-based image recognition reproduces biases of contemporary practice. It also invites reflection on how mixed methods, integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches, can be established and used in research in the humanities. Finally, it opens new perspectives on the role of crowdsourcing in both knowledge dissemination and shared research. Attempts to analyze historical big data with the latest methods of deep learning, to involve many people—laymen and experts—in research via crowdsourcing and to deal with partly unknown visual material have provided a better understanding of what is possible. The article presents findings from the ongoing research project ArchiMediaL, which is at the forefront of the analysis of historical mediatizations of the built environment. It demonstrates how the combination of crowdsourcing, historical big data and deep learning simultaneously raises questions and provides solutions in the field of architectural and urban planning history. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",Artificial intelligence; Automated image content recognition; Big data; Computer vision; Crowdsourcing; Image repositories; Urban heritage,,,,,,,,"Tu Delft News, (2017); P7003algorithmic Bias Considerations, (2017); Alloa, Emmanuel, Iconic turn: A plea for three turns of the screw, Culture, Theory and Critique, 57, 2, pp. 228-250, (2016); Amato, Giuseppe, Fast image classification for monument recognition, Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage, 8, 4, (2015); Andrianaivo, Louis Nantenaina, ARCHITECTURE RECOGNITION by MEANS of CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 42, 2/W15, pp. 77-84, (2019); Image Matching Crowdsourcing Tool, (2020); Assemblage, (1987); Fabricating Architecture Selected Readings in Digital Design and Manufacturing, (2012); Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research, (2007); Bauhausideen Bibliographie Und Beitrage Zur Rezeption Des Bauhausgedankens Bauhaus Ideas Bibliography and Contributions on the Reception of the Bauhaus Idea, (1994)","T.

Spatial statistics such as Moran’s I indicator can only reveal the spatial autocorrelation of urban green space or urban landscape itself, while the dynamic changes of urban green space and urban landscape in spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity must be investigated under spatio-temporal contexts, with possible driving factors such as urban climate and urbanization process taken into account. The purpose of this paper was to study the dynamics of urban greenness patterns using urban landscape indices as well as the spatial association of the indices with the climate changes and urbanization process. Wuhan, a key megacity in Central China was selected as the case study. To this end, we mapped the urban greenness through NDVI of the city from 2000 to 2018 using Landsat imagery. The dynamics of the urban green space indicated by two landscape indices, namely Percent of landscape (PLAND) and landscape shape index (LSI), was analyzed for the study region. Time-series analysis using Mann-Kendall and Sen’s slope were adopted to reveal the temporal changes of the landscape pattern and Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to explain its association with the climate changes and urbanization process. Results indicated that urban greenness not only significantly decreased but also fragmented. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Climate; Greenness landscape pattern; Mann-Kendall; Urbanization,Artificial intelligence; Ecosystems; Time series analysis; Correlation analysis; Spatial associations; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial correlations; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial statistics; Urban green spaces; Urban landscape patterns; Climate change,,,,,,,"Wolch, Jennifer R., Urban green space, public health, and environmental justice: The challenge of making cities 'just green enough, Landscape and Urban Planning, 125, pp. 234-244, (2014); Grimmond, Sue Sue B., Initial results from Phase 2 of the international urban energy balance model comparison, International Journal of Climatology, 31, 2, pp. 244-272, (2011); Pataki, Diane E., Coupling biogeochemical cycles in urban environments: Ecosystem services, green solutions, and misconceptions, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 9, 1, pp. 27-36, (2011); Musolff, Andreas, Micropollutant loads in the urban water cycle, Environmental Science and Technology, 44, 13, pp. 4877-4883, (2010); Horwood, Karen, Green infrastructure: Reconciling urban green space and regional economic development: Lessons learnt from experience in England's north-west region, Local Environment, 16, 10, pp. 963-975, (2011); Zhou, Xiaolu, Spatial-temporal dynamics of urban green space in response to rapid urbanization and greening policies, Landscape and Urban Planning, 100, 3, pp. 268-277, (2011); Progress in Geography, (2009); Park, Jonghoon, The influence of small green space type and structure at the street level on urban heat island mitigation, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 21, pp. 203-212, (2017); Miller, Todd F., Old-growth northern hardwood forests: Spatial autocorrelation and patterns of understory vegetation, Ecological Monographs, 72, 4, pp. 487-503, (2002); Wu, Shuyao, Relationships between urban development level and urban vegetation states: A global perspective, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 38, pp. 215-222, (2019)","J.

Reality, one of the most important elements in virtual reality technology, means visual expression so that a person can experience three-dimensional space like reality. To obtain this realism, real-world data are used in the various fields. For example, in order to increase the realism of 3D modeled building textures real aerial images are utilized in 3D modelling. However, the aerial image captured during the day can be shadowed by the sun and it can cause the distortion or deterioration of image. To resolve this problem, researches on detecting and removing shadows have been conducted, but the detecting and removing shadow is still considered as a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting and removing shadows using deep learning. For this work, we first a build a new dataset of photo-realistic synthetic urban data based on the virtual environment using 3D spatial information provided by VWORLD. For detecting and removing shadow from the dataset, firstly, the 1-channel shadow mask image is inferred from the 3-channel shadow image through the CNN. Then, to generate a shadow-free image, a 3-channel shadow image and a detected 1-channel shadow mask into the GAN is executed. From the experiments, we can prove that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in detecting and removing shadow. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

However, when it comes to measuring the built density, a difficulty has been observed in defining valid measurement indicators universally. With the intention of identifying the variables that allow the best characterization of the shape of urban fabrics and of obtaining the metrics of their density, a multi-variable analysis methodology from the field of artificial intelligence is proposed. The main objective of this paper was to evaluate the capacity and interest of such a methodology from standard indicators of the built density, measured at various urban scales, (i) to cluster differentiated urban profiles in a robust way by assessing the results statistically, and (ii) to obtain the metrics that characterize them with an identity. As a case study, this methodology was applied to the state of the art European urban fabrics (N = 117) by simultaneously integrating 13 regular parameters to qualify urban shape and density. It was verified that the profiles obtained were more robust than those based on a limited number of indicators, evidencing that the proposed methodology offers operational opportunities in urban management by allowing the comparison of a fabric with the identified profiles. © 2019 by the authors.

The penetration of such class of algorithms in cities and design disciplines is rapid and profound, increasing both the thirst for gathering ever larger and more accurate datasets and raising the prospect of automating tasks currently performed by humans. Whilst it is understood that learning algorithms are essential tools to analyse large datasets, design disciplines have paid far less attention to how such processes are carried out, how spatial data are reformatted by algorithms which largely operate on statistical bases and, most importantly, what image of the city emerges from such processes. To unravel the complexity of the issue, it is first necessary to retrace the ideas informing the emergence of numerical procedures as they developed since the beginning of the twentieth century as they allow us to project a different paradigm of how space can be analysed, structured, and changed. Finally, the paper will offer some points for speculation and further reflection on how the methods put forward through learning algorithms compare to current approaches to digital design; this will foreground their disruptive potential for a radical transformation of urban design, one that could be deployed to tackle some of the most pressing urban issue. © 2019, Architectural Research Centers Consortium.

The advent of machine learning and data mining techniques have geared the problem from simple analysis of data to knowledge discovery from data. This work attempts to mine urban landscapes to find the change pattern which has happened over the region for a period of interest. The work proposes a spatiotemporal-metric miner, which uses the spatial, temporal and landscape metric data to discover the change that has occurred in a region. The model works on a hierarchical basis, wherein, the regions of interest are chosen in a landscape and are aggregated to find the change that has happened over the entire region. The entire model is built by taking advantage of the tensorized representation of data, and thus resulting in the effective mining of tensors. The growth of a landscape is evaluated regarding two parameters, namely, Inter-class Growth Index and Intra-class Growth Index. Experiments are performed on the landscape regions of Indian cities, and a ranking of cities is presented based on the growth indices, which are validated against standards. In the experiments, Jaipur city showed the highest Inter-class Growth Index value of 2.68 and Surat city had an Intra-class Growth Index of 0.78. © 2019, Korean Spatial Information Society.",Change detection; Data mining; Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal mining,Change detection; Remote sensing; Tensors; Factorization approach; Growth indices; Inter class; Intra class; Remote-sensing; Research challenges; Spatio-temporal minings; Tensor factorization; Urban landscape; Data mining,,,,,,,"Acker, James G., Online analysis enhances use of NASA Earth Science Data, Eos, 88, 2, pp. 14-17, (2007); Hwang, Do-hyun, Study of the temporal and spatial analysis by using SST satellite data, International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, 11, 12, pp. 149-160, (2016); Liu, Xiaoping, Simulating urban growth by integrating landscape expansion index (LEI) and cellular automata, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 28, 1, pp. 148-163, (2014); Park, Soyoung, Prediction and comparison of urban growth by land suitability index mapping using GIS and RS in South Korea, Landscape and Urban Planning, 99, 2, pp. 104-114, (2011); Vakalopoulou, Maria, Building detection in very high resolution multispectral data with deep learning features, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2015-November, pp. 1873-1876, (2015); Albert, Adrian, Using convolutional networks and satellite imagery to identify patterns in urban environments at a large scale, Part F129685, pp. 1357-1366, (2017); Hu, Tengyun, Mapping urban land use by using landsat images and open social data, Remote Sensing, 8, 2, (2016); Lang, Stefan Christian, Landscape metrics – a toolbox for assessing past, present and future landscape structures, pp. 207-234, (2008); Tewkesbury, Andrew P., A critical synthesis of remotely sensed optical image change detection techniques, Remote Sensing of Environment, 160, pp. 1-14, (2015); Alphan, Hakan, Post-classification comparison of land cover using multitemporal Landsat and ASTER imagery: The case of Kahramanmaras, Turkey, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 151, 1-4, pp. 327-336, (2009)","S.

For centuries, understanding these places has been limited to sporadic observations and laborious data collection. This study proposes a novel methodology to analyze citywide, discrete urban spaces using highly accurate anonymized telecom data and machine learning algorithms. Through superposition of human dynamics and urban features, this work aims to expose clear correlations between the design of the city and the behavioral patterns of its users. Geolocated telecom data, obtained for the state of Andorra, were initially analyzed to identify “stay-points”—events in which cellular devices remain within a certain roaming distance for a given length of time. These stay-points were then further analyzed to find clusters of activity characterized in terms of their size, persistence, and diversity. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify associations between the formation of these clusters and various urban features such as urban morphology or land-use within a 25–50 meters resolution. Some of the urban features that were found to be highly related to the creation of large, diverse and long-lasting clusters were the presence of service and entertainment amenities, natural water features, and the betweenness centrality of the road network; others, such as educational and park amenities were shown to have a negative impact. Ultimately, this study suggests a “reversed urbanism” methodology: an evidence-based approach to urban design, planning, and decision making, in which human behavioral patterns are instilled as a foundational design tool for inferring the success rates of highly performative urban places. © The Author(s) 2019.",human dynamics; machine learning; spatial analysis; telecom data; Urban design,decision making; machine learning; telecommunication; temporal record; urban design; urban development; urban morphology; urban planning,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT","This study would not be possible without the collaboration between MIT and the State of Andorra.

With the help of recently emerged street view images and machine learning algorithms, an evaluation model has been trained to assess the perceived visual quality with accuracy similar to that of experienced urban designers, to provide full coverage and detailed results for a citywide area. The town centre of Shanghai was selected for the site. Around 140,000 screenshots from Baidu Street View were processed and a machine learning algorithm, SegNet, was applied to intelligently extract the pixels representing key elements affecting the visual quality of streets, including the building frontage, greenery, sky view, pedestrian space, motorisation, and diversity. A Java-based program was then produced to automatically collect the preferences of experienced urban designers on representative sample images. Another machine learning algorithm, i.e. an artificial neural network, was used to train an evaluation model to achieve a citywide, high-resolution evaluation of the visual quality of the streets. Further validation through different approaches shows this evaluation model obtains a satisfactory accuracy. The results from the artificial neural network also help to explore the high or low effects of various key elements on visual quality. In short, this study contributes to the development of human-centred planning and design by providing continuous measurements of an ‘unmeasurable’ quality across large-scale areas. Meanwhile, insights on the perceptual-based visual quality and detailed mapping of various key elements in streets can assist in more efficient street renewal by providing accurate design guidance. © The Author(s) 2019.",machine learning; street; Street view images; urban design; visual quality,accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; guideline; image analysis; image resolution; machine learning; mapping method; pixel; quantitative analysis; urban design; China; Shanghai,,,,,,,"Badrinarayanan, Vijay, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); undefined, (2015); City Sense and City Design Writings and Projects of Kevin Lynch, (1990); Bargh, John A., Automaticity of Social Behavior: Direct Effects of Trait Construct and Stereotype Activation on Action, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, 2, pp. 230-244, (1996); undefined, (2014); undefined, (2016); Doersch, Carl, What makes paris look like Paris?, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 31, 4, (2012); Rating of Chess Players Past and Present, (1978); Ewing, Reid H., Measuring the unmeasurable: Urban design qualities related to walkability, Journal of Urban Design, 14, 1, pp. 65-84, (2009); AI Expert, (1991)","Y.

The relationships between urban design parameters and multiple performance should be stipulated to evaluate scenarios for supporting timely and reliable design decisions. However, there are three major challenges: (1) only a few design alternatives are devised, (2) the multiple performance has not been provided synthetically, and (3) the relationships between design parameters and performance are difficult to be determined because they are multivariate relationships. This research proposes a new methodology applying a generative design approach using a reinforcement learning algorithm, a parametric performance modeling, and a multivariate adaptive regression splines approach to identify relationships between design parameters and urban performance. This research aims to support decision-making of urban design to achieve an energy efficient and visually qualified urban environment. A data-driven urban design approach is proposed to generate possible design alternatives using reinforcement learning, and a design-driven analysis is conducted to evaluate multiple performance of urban buildings using parametric modeling. The multivariate analysis presented relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria by using 30 samples. The findings show that to maintain optimal solar potential, the building coverage ratio is recommended to be bigger than 0.17. To maintain the optimal energy balance, the threshold for sky view factor is recommended as 54.17%. These relationships contribute to deriving design strategies and guidelines for designing a sustainable campus. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Data-driven design; Design-driven energy and visibility performance; Generative design; Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS); Parametric modeling; Reinforcement learning,Decision making; Energy efficiency; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multivariant analysis; Building coverage ratios; Data-driven design; Generative design; Multi variate analysis; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Parametric modeling; Parametric performance; Performance criterion; Reinforcement learning; building; design method; methodology; modeling; multivariate analysis; parameter estimation; solar radiation; urban design; urban region,,,,,,,"undefined; undefined, (2013); undefined, (2018); Pérez-Lombard, Luis, A review on buildings energy consumption information, Energy and Buildings, 40, 3, pp. 394-398, (2008); Nutkiewicz, Alex, Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S): A framework for integrating engineering simulation and machine learning methods in a multi-scale urban energy modeling workflow, Applied Energy, 225, pp. 1176-1189, (2018); Nutkiewicz, Alex, Energy modeling of urban informal settlement redevelopment: Exploring design parameters for optimal thermal comfort in Dharavi, Mumbai, India, Applied Energy, 231, pp. 433-445, (2018); undefined, (1977); Yang, Xiaoshan, An integrated simulation method for building energy performance assessment in urban environments, Energy and Buildings, 54, pp. 243-251, (2012); Quan, Steven Jige, Urban form and building energy performance in Shanghai neighborhoods, Energy Procedia, 88, pp. 126-132, (2016); Quan, Steven Jige, A GIS-based Energy Balance Modeling System for Urban Solar Buildings, Energy Procedia, 75, pp. 2946-2952, (2015)","P.P.-J.

The analysis of visuals, materializes a landscape value, not evidenced at the time of planning and design projects for cities with value surroundings; you can take as an example those good practices that other countries have implemented to assess, preserve and protect views such as English Heritage (2011), London View Management Framework (2012) or View Protection Guidelines of the city of Vancouver (2011). The methodological analyzes the view in two stages: the first one strategic points of observation and view basins are identified and described as element integrators &ndash; what is seen, and through citizen participation accepts or does not accept the evaluation criteria; in the second, the view is evaluated through the relationship between quality and incidence, giving it an assessment of how fragile it is. The application of the methodology in the area known as El Ejido in the city of Cuenca &ndash; Ecuador, has resulted in a total of twentyeight visuals considered relevant. Nine of them, have been analyzed completely, evidencing that there is a view quality very High / High; nevertheless, they are affected by urban actions that generate that the incidence is High and therefore the fragility and vulnerability is greater. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

However, to date, most of the previous studies have largely focused on the use of coarse- or moderate-resolution data, with which it may not be possible to identify the land-use classes in urban environments. Due to the improved spatial details, high-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery provides us with an opportunity for the semantic interpretation of urban landscapes. Therefore, in this study, we took the City of Shenzhen (1997 km2) in China as an example to assess the detailed land-use change and its effect on ecosystem services (ESs), based on HR satellite data from 2005 to 2017. In particular, deep learning was used to obtain accurate land-use maps, because this technique is able to model the hierarchical representations of features and can thus effectively characterize urban scenes. The results revealed the following findings: (a) The overall accuracy of the proposed approach was 96.9% and 97.1% for 2005 and 2017, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art semantic classification models; (b) residential and commercial areas in Shenzhen increased dramatically over the study period by 10,416 and 9,168 ha, at the expense of ecological land; (c) supply capacity of the ecosystem decreased by 13.7%, but demand for ESs showed an increase of 23.5%. By courtesy of HR images, detailed land-use changes and the associated ESs can be monitored, which facilitates the in-depth understanding of urban environmental systems. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ecosystem service; land degradation; land-use development; urban environment; urbanization,Ecosystems; Image enhancement; Land use; Remote sensing; Semantics; Urban planning; Ecosystem services; Hierarchical representation; High-resolution remotely sensed imageries; Land degradation; Semantic classification; Semantic interpretation; Urban environments; urbanization; Deep learning; accuracy assessment; ecosystem service; environmental monitoring; land degradation; land use change; learning; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (2017CFA029, 41771360); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","Funding text 1: Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017CFA029; National Program for Support of Top‐notch Young Professionals; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41771360; Funding text 2: dation of China under Grant 41771360, the National Program for; Funding text 3: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foun-","Abulizi, Abudukeyimu, Land-Use Change and its Effects in Charchan Oasis, Xinjiang, China, Land Degradation and Development, 28, 1, pp. 106-115, (2017); Ayanu, Yohannes Zergaw, Quantifying and mapping ecosystem services supplies and demands: A review of remote sensing applications, Environmental Science and Technology, 46, 16, pp. 8529-8541, (2012); Journal of Natural Resources, (2000); Bai, Yang, Developing China’s Ecological Redline Policy using ecosystem services assessments for land use planning, Nature Communications, 9, 1, (2018); Burkhard, Benjamin, Mapping ecosystem service supply, demand and budgets, Ecological Indicators, 21, pp. 17-29, (2012); Cakir, Günay, Evaluating urbanization, fragmentation and land use/land cover change pattern in Istanbul city, Turkey from 1971 to 2002, Land Degradation and Development, 19, 6, pp. 663-675, (2008); Chen, Kouping, Multivariate statistical evaluation of trace elements in groundwater in a coastal area in Shenzhen, China, Environmental Pollution, 147, 3, pp. 771-780, (2007); Technical Specification for Updating the Second National Land Survey Database, (2007); World Cities Report 2016, (2016); Chuai, Xiaowei, Land degradation monitoring using terrestrial ecosystem carbon sinks/sources and their response to climate change in China, Land Degradation and Development, 29, 10, pp. 3489-3502, (2018)","X.

The most distinctive elements in the urban landscape - categorised in paths, nodes, edges, districts and landmarks - give shape to individuals’ mental representation of the city. Lynch's approach has stimulated research into spatial cognition, urban design and artificial intelligence, and it still represents an essential pillar in the analysis of urban dynamics. Nevertheless, an explicit link between The Image of the City and GIScience has not been completely explored yet. In this paper, a computational approach to The Image of the City is proposed. Different perspectives in spatial cognition and GIS research are integrated to obtain a complete Image of the City, in which the most salient elements are shared by a large part of citizens. Nodes, paths and districts were identified through network science techniques. Methods drawn from the information approach to The Image of the City are used to detect landmarks, integrating the complexity of points of reference in their visual, structural and semantic components, as conceptualised by Lynch and successive research. The methods were applied to the central area of Boston and built using freely available spatial datasets. Results were compared to Lynch's maps to evaluate the methodology: besides a considerable discrepancy with regard to landmarks, a good correspondence for paths, nodes, edges and districts was found. © 2019 The Authors",Cognitive maps; GIScience; Image of the City; Kevin Lynch; Street network,GIS; mapping; numerical model; public space; urban area; urban design,,,,,,,"Appleyard, Donald, Why buildings are known: A Predictive Tool for Architects and Planners, Environment and Behavior, 1, 2, pp. 131-156, (1969); Environment and Planning B, (1979); Blondel, Vincent, Fast unfolding of communities in large networks, Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2008, 10, (2008); undefined, (2017); Cooper, Crispin H.V., Spatial localization of closeness and betweenness measures: a self-contradictory but useful form of network analysis, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 29, 8, pp. 1293-1309, (2015); Couclelis, Helen M., Exploring the anchor-point hypothesis of spatial cognition, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 7, 2, pp. 99-122, (1987); Proceedings of the 4th International Space Syntax Symposium, (2003); Mind and Maze Spatial Cognition and Environmental Behavior, (2001); Elias, Birgit, Extracting landmarks with data mining methods, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2825, pp. 375-389, (2003); 5th International Space Syntax Symposium, (2005)","G.

However, most studies so far have focused on only few features, such as street greenery or accessibility. These features fail to capture people’s holistic perceptions. The potential of fine grained, multi-sourced urban data creates new research avenues for addressing multi-feature, intangible, human-oriented issues related to the built environment. This study proposes a systematic, multi-factor quantitative approach for measuring street quality with the support of multi-sourced urban data taking Yangpu District in Shanghai as case study. This holistic approach combines typical and new urban data in order to measure street quality with a human-oriented perspective. This composite measure of street quality is based on the well-established 5Ds dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Destination accessibility and Distance to transit. They are combined as a collection of new urban data and research techniques, including location-based service (LBS) positioning data, points of interest (PoIs), elements and visual quality of street-view images extraction with supervised machine learning, and accessibility metrics using network science. According to these quantitative measurements from the five aspects, streets were classified into eight feature clusters and three types reflecting the value of street quality using a hierarchical clustering method. The classification was tested with experts. The analytical framework developed through this study contributes to human-oriented urban planning practices to further encourage physical activity and public health. © 2019 by the author.

To this end, we estimated statistical models that fused multi-temporal very fine spatial (20 cm) and vertical (1 mm) resolution imagery, that captures the complexity of urban vegetation, with remotely sensed temperature data to assess how urban vegetation configuration influences urban temperatures. Perth, Western Australia, was used as a case-study for this analysis. Panel regression models showed that within a location an increase in tree and shrub cover has a larger cooling effect than grass coverage. On average, holding all else equal, an approximate 1 km 2 increase in shrub (tree) cover within a location reduces surface temperatures by 12 °C (5 °C). We included a range of robustness checks for the observed relationships between urban vegetation type and temperature. Geographically weighted regression models showed spatial variation in the cooling effect of different vegetation types; this indicates that i) unobserved factors moderate temperature-vegetation relationships across urban landscapes, and ii) that urban vegetation type and temperature relationships are complex. Machine learning models (Random Forests) were used to further explore complex and non-linear relationships between different urban vegetation configurations and temperature. The Random Forests showed that vegetation type explained 31.84% of the out-of-bag variance in summer surface temperatures, that increased cover of large vegetation within a location increases cooling, and that different configurations of urban vegetation structure can lead to cooling gains.

Conventional approaches to control energy efficiency of buildings mainly focus on materials and capacity of insulation, but rarely consider urban and building geometries. By examining energy impacts on urban blocks by urban geometric forms, this paper seeks to identify urban geometric types and energy patterns on urban blocks. To achieve the aims of this study, this paper follows two steps: First, significant indicators for analyzing energy performance are identified in urban geometries; second, the types that capture urban geometry of a real city are categorized. As a result, as a reference for urban planning and design, the paper identifies 13 types that represent the characteristics of urban geometries regarding energy performance. The geometric indicators are carefully measured and their significance to energy performance of buildings is examined through regression analysis. According to these indicators, the 13 types are categorized using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, a machine learning method. Additionally, the 13 types are discussed for implementation as references in urban planning and design, particularly in block planning for a city. © 2018 International Energy Initiative",Cluster analysis; Energy; Typology; Urban block; Urban form; Urban geometry,Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Geometry; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Urban planning; Energy; Typology; Urban blocks; Urban form; Urban geometry; Energy efficiency; building; cluster analysis; energy use; geometry; machine learning; performance assessment; regression analysis; urban design; urban planning,,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE, (- 2018R1D1A1B07046164); Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT, (2017M3C1A6075020); Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF- 2017M3C1A6075020); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","Funding text 1: This study was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF- 2018R1D1A1B07046164 ), the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT for convergent research in EDucation-research Integration through Simulation On the Net(EDISON)(NRF- 2017M3C1A6075020 ) and the Korea Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) as U-City Master and Doctor Course Grant Program.; Funding text 2: This study was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2018R1D1A1B07046164), the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT for convergent research in EDucation-research Integration through Simulation On the Net(EDISON)(NRF- 2017M3C1A6075020) and the Korea Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) as U-City Master and Doctor Course Grant Program.","Ali-Toudert, Fazia, Numerical study on the effects of aspect ratio and orientation of an urban street canyon on outdoor thermal comfort in hot and dry climate, Building and Environment, 41, 2, pp. 94-108, (2006); Ali-Toudert, Fazia, Effects of asymmetry, galleries, overhanging façades and vegetation on thermal comfort in urban street canyons, Solar Energy, 81, 6, pp. 742-754, (2007); Andersson, Brandt, The impact of building orientation on residential heating and cooling, Energy and Buildings, 8, 3, pp. 205-224, (1985); Energy and Environment in Architecture A Technical Design Guide, (2000); Bolattürk, Ali, Determination of optimum insulation thickness for building walls with respect to various fuels and climate zones in Turkey, Applied Thermal Engineering, 26, 11-12, pp. 1301-1309, (2006); Cheng, Vicky, Urban form, density and solar potential, pp. I701-I706, (2006); Çomaklı, Kemal, Optimum insulation thickness of external walls for energy saving, Applied Thermal Engineering, 23, 4, pp. 473-479, (2003); Sun Wind Light Architectural Design Strategies, (2001); Energy in Architecture the European Passive Solar Handbook, (1992); Kaufman, Léonard, Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis, pp. 1-342, (2008)","Y.

Urban landscapes are found to be significant antecedents, with different influential importance in both components (modern space/ancient space/ecological/living/social landscapes) and elements. Besides, the impacts of urban destination personalities on overall destination image are identified, and the mediating effects of urban destination personalities on the relationship between urban landscapes and overall destination image are discovered.

This new research tendency requires a new planning support system. Since there are existing decision support systems for both meso and macro scale urban planning, this research puts forward that a micro-scale support system for planning should be constructed. This system should considerate human’s subjective feelings and needs as the core, and should be organized in three categories: ecological elements in micro living environment, urban design elements in local space, and individual behavior elements. Based on this, three sub-systems are proposed. For the first, the natural environment and ecological factors involved in micro-scale urban planning are the research objects, and this sub-system is established according to the logic of “cause-effect-response” model. Secondly, by integrating quantitative research and evaluation methods for urban design, the sub-system of urban design and spatial layout provides support for micro urban design simulation and local area design optimization, from the dimensions of urban perception, spatial morphology and function optimization. Lastly, the sub-system of human behavior and community life is based on the urban space-time behavioral theory and is applied to urban space-time analysis residential area planning, functional area planning, traffic planning, etc. These sub-systems will play an essential role in the future vital work such as central-city-planning, urban-physical-examination and livable-city-construction. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Human-oriented; Micro-ecology; Micro-scale planning; Planning framework; Planning support system; Urban design,Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Decision support systems; Ecology; Regional planning; Urban growth; Function Optimization; Human-oriented; Natural environments; Planning framework; Planning support systems; Quantitative research; Spatial morphologies; Urban design; Behavioral research,,,,,,,"Improving Urban Legibility and Design for Barriers Free Environment an Approach Towards Micro Scale Urban Design, (2004); Digital Government Advanced Research and Case Studies, (2007); Topaz Planning Techniques and Applications, (1980); Public Places Urban Spaces the Dimensions of Urban Design, (2003); Progress in Geography, (2013); Charnes, Abraham, Measuring the efficiency of decision making units, European Journal of Operational Research, 2, 6, pp. 429-444, (1978); J Green Sci Technol, (2018); Location of Industry and the Depressed Areas, (1939); Proceedings of the Workshop Organized by the Land and Water Development Division FAO Agriculture Department, (1997); Nature and Cities the Ecological Imperative in Urban Design and Planning, (2016)","D.

Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding these perceptions may be useful to inform the design, management and planning process of public spaces. Recently, several studies have used data collected at a massive scale and machine learning methods to quantify these perceptions, showing promising results in terms of predictive performance. Nevertheless, most of these models can be of little help in understanding users’ perceptions due to the difficulty associated with identifying the importance of each attribute of landscapes. In this work, we propose a novel approach to quantify perceptions of landscapes through discrete choice models, using semantic segmentations of images of public spaces, generated through machine learning algorithms, as explanatory variables. The proposed models are estimated using the Place Pulse dataset, with over 1.2 million perceptual indicators, and are able to provide useful insights into how users perceive the built environment as a function of its features. The models obtained are used to infer perceptual variables in the city of Santiago, Chile, and show they have a significant correlation with socioeconomic indicators. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Discrete choice models; Machine learning; Perceptions; Public spaces,Image segmentation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Semantics; Sensory perception; Discrete choice models; Explanatory variables; Machine learning methods; Predictive performance; Public space; Semantic segmentation; Socio-economic indicators; Subjective perceptions; Learning algorithms; discrete choice analysis; machine learning; perception; performance assessment; planning process; prediction; public space; segmentation; urban design; Chile; Metropolitana,,,,,"Volvo Research and Educational Foundations, VREF; Instituto de Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería, ISCI, (FBO16); Instituto de Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería, ISCI; Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, CEDEUS, (CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020); Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, CEDEUS","This research was partially funded by the Complex Engineering Systems Institute , ISCI (ICM: P-05-004-F, CONICYT:FBO16), the Centre for Sustainable Urban Development , CEDEUS (CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020), and the BRT + Centre of Excellence funded by the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations ( VREF ).","Adler, Philip D.F., Auditing black-box models for indirect influence, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, 0, pp. 1-10, (2016); Transprtation Research Part A Policy and Practice, (1995); undefined, (2015); Proceedings of the 3rd Swiss Transportation Research Conference, (2003); Bollen, Kenneth Alan, Latent variables in psychology and the social sciences, Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 605-634, (2002); Bonaiuto, Marino, Indexes of perceived residential environment quality and neighbourhood attachment in urban environments: A confirmation study on the city of Rome, Landscape and Urban Planning, 65, 1-2, pp. 41-52, (2003); Borsboom, Denny, The Theoretical Status of Latent Variables, Psychological Review, 110, 2, pp. 203-219, (2003); Brostow, Gabriel J., Semantic object classes in video: A high-definition ground truth database, Pattern Recognition Letters, 30, 2, pp. 88-97, (2009); Cañas-Guerrero, Ignacio, A contribution to the assessment of scenic quality of landscapes based on preferences expressed by the public, Land Use Policy, 26, 4, pp. 1173-1181, (2009); Canny, John F., A Computational Approach to Edge Detection, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, PAMI-8, 6, pp. 679-698, (1986)",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,1692046,,LUPLE,,English,Landsc.

At the same time, big data technology is developing rapidly, with the availability of various types of high-precision data being gradually increased. The combination of big data and urban design plays an important role in the urban design of transition period. This paper describes the design of urban education system under the big data platform. With the traditional teaching model, which include four stage (research, topic, design and expression), big data technologies are divided into four aspects to consider how to apply the big data to the teaching of urban design. Specifically summarized: big data “accelerate” researching, big data “secondary” analysis, big data “enhanced” design and big data of “optimization” expression. The aim of this research is to let the traditional teaching system and cutting-edge technology of large data collide with each other fusion, which can not only enrich the existing education system, but also establish a complete technical structure. On this basis, it can help students establish and improve the construction, and the ability to learn new technologies, to promote the progress of urban design techniques. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Application Paradigm; Big data; Teaching system; Urban design,Artificial intelligence; Availability; Design; Education computing; Cutting edge technology; Data technologies; Education systems; Teaching systems; Technical structures; Transition period; Urban design; Urban educations; Big data,,,,,,,"Chinese City Planning Annual Meeting Proceedings, (2015); International Urban Planning, (2014); New Science of Cities, (2013); Batty, Michael J., Urban Modeling, pp. 51-58, (2009); Urban Planning Forum, (2015); Architectural Journal, (2016); Urban Design Research and Application Based on 3D Digital Technology, (2009); Urban Planning Journal, (2009); Urban Planning International 2015, (2015); Urban Space and Structures, (1972)",,"Yue, X.--G.",Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org,"International Engineering and Technology Institute, Hong Kong","2018 International Symposium on Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, ISBDAI 2018",2018-12-29 through 2018-12-30,Hong Kong,144894,21531633,9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201; 9781450364454,,,English,ACM Int.

This study bridges in-situ observations of pedestrian activity and urban computing by integrating high-resolution, large-scale, and heterogeneous urban datasets and analyzing both fixed attributes of the urban landscape (e.g. physical and transit infrastructure) with dynamic environmental and socio-psychological factors, such as weather, air quality, and perceived crime risk. We use local pedestrian count data collected by the New York City (NYC) Department of Transportation (DOT) and an extensive array of open datasets from NYC to test how pedestrian volumes relate to land use, building density, streetscape quality, transportation infrastructure, and other factors typically associated with urban walkability. We quantify, classify, and analyze place dynamics, including contextual and situational factors that influence pedestrian activity at high spatial–temporal resolution. The quantification process measures the urban context by extracting rich, yet initially fragmented and siloed, urban data for individual geolocations. Based on these features, we then construct contextual indicators by selecting and combining features relevant to pedestrian activity, and develop a typology of place to support the generalizability of our analysis. Finally, we use multivariate regression models with panel-corrected standard errors to estimate how specific contextual features and time-varying situational indicators impact pedestrian activity across time of day, day of the week, season, and year. The results provide insights into the key drivers of local pedestrian activity and highlight the importance accounting for the immediate urban environment and socio-spatial dynamics in pedestrian behavior modeling. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Pedestrian mobility; Urban computing; Urban data; Urban planning; Walkability,Air quality; Bridges; Economics; Land use; Large dataset; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Regression analysis; Urban planning; Department of Transportation; Multivariate regression models; Pedestrian behavior model; Pedestrian mobility; Transportation infrastructures; Urban computing; Urban data; Walkability; Urban transportation; data set; landscape; machine learning; pedestrian; quantitative analysis; urban area; urban design; urban ecosystem; urban planning; urban transport; walking; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States,,,,,,,"A Pattern Language Towns Buildings Construction, (1977); Aultman-Hall, Lisa, Assessing impact of weather and season on pedestrian traffic volumes, Transportation Research Record, 2140, pp. 35-43, (2009); undefined, (1998); Beck, Nathaniel L., What to do (and not to do) with time-series cross-section data, American Political Science Review, 89, 3, pp. 634-647, (1995); Social Education, (1994); European Transport Conference, (2016); Brown, Barbara B., Mixed land use and walkability: Variations in land use measures and relationships with BMI, overweight, and obesity, Health and Place, 15, 4, pp. 1130-1141, (2009); Brownson, Ross C., Measuring the Built Environment for Physical Activity.

Nevertheless, it remains difficult to obtain accurate and timely ULC information. This study presents a methodological framework for fusing optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at the pixel level with manifolds to improve ULC classification. Three typical manifold learning models, namely, ISOMAP, Local Linear Embedding (LLE) and principle component analysis (PCA), were employed, and their results were compared. SPOT-5 data were used as optical data to be fused with three different SAR datasets. Experimental results showed that 1) the most useful information of the optical and SAR data were included in the manifolds with intrinsic dimensionality, while various ULC classes were distributed differently throughout the feature spaces of manifolds derived from different learning methods; 2) in certain cases, ISOMAP performed comparably to PCA, but PCA generally performed the best out of all the study cases, yielding the best producer's and user's accuracy of all ULC classes and requiring the least amount of time to build the machine learning models; and 3) the LLE-derived manifolds yielded the lowest accuracy, primarily by confusing bare soils with dark impervious surfaces and vegetation. These results indicate the effectiveness of the new manifold technology to fuse optical and SAR data at the pixel level for improving ULC classification, which can be applied in practice to support the accurate analysis of urban landscape. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Manifold learning; Multisource data fusion; Optical and SAR; Urban land covers,Data fusion; Ecology; Pixels; Synthetic aperture radar; Intrinsic dimensionalities; Manifold learning; Methodological frameworks; Multisource data; Optical and SAR; Principle component analysis; Urban land cover; Urban land cover classification; Learning systems; accuracy assessment; experimental study; land classification; land cover; landscape ecology; learning; optical method; principal component analysis; radar; satellite data; urban area,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41401370); Ministry of Education, MOE; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (14601515, 14635916, CUHK 14605917); Fuzhou University, FZU, (2016LSDMIS02)","This study was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41401370 ), the Research Grants Council (RGC) General Research Fund ( CUHK 14601515 , CUHK 14635916 and CUHK 14605917 ), the Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining & Information Sharing of Ministry of Education , Fuzhou University (No. 2016LSDMIS02 ) and the Major Special Project-the China High-Resolution Earth Observation System .

However, insufficient weather stations limit accurate spatial representation of temperature within a heterogeneous city. This study used a random forest machine learning approach to estimate daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (T<inf>max</inf> and T<inf>min</inf>) for two megacities with different climate characteristics: Los Angeles, USA, and Seoul, South Korea. This study used eight time-series land surface temperature (LST) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with seven auxiliary variables: elevation, solar radiation, normalized difference vegetation index, latitude, longitude, aspect, and the percentage of impervious area. We found different relationships between the eight time-series LSTs with T<inf>max</inf>/T<inf>min</inf> for the two cities, and designed eight schemes with different input LST variables. The schemes were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 10-fold cross-validation. The best schemes produced R2 of 0.850 and 0.777 and RMSE of 1.7 °C and 1.2 °C for T<inf>max</inf> and T<inf>min</inf> in Los Angeles, and R2 of 0.728 and 0.767 and RMSE of 1.1 °C and 1.2 °C for T<inf>max</inf> and T<inf>min</inf> in Seoul, respectively. LSTs obtained the day before were crucial for estimating daily urban air temperature. Estimated air temperature patterns showed that T<inf>max</inf> was highly dependent on the geographic factors (e.g., sea breeze, mountains) of the two cities, while T<inf>min</inf> showed marginally distinct temperature differences between built-up and vegetated areas in the two cities. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

To collect the data needed to evaluate street frontage quality at the city or regional level using traditional survey method is both costly and time consuming. As a result, this research proposes a pipeline that uses convolutional neural network to classify the frontage of a street image through the case study of Greater London. A novelty of the research is it uses both Google streetview images and 3D-model generated streetview images for the classification. The benefit of this approach is that it can provide a framework to test different urban parameters to help evaluate future urban design projects. The research finds encouraging results in classifying urban frontage quality using deep learning models. This research also finds that augmenting the baseline model with images produced from a 3Dmodel can improve slightly the accuracy of the results. However these results should be taken as preliminary, wherewe acknowledge several limitations such as the lack of adversarial analysis, labeled data, or parameter tuning. Despite these limitations, the results of the proof-of-concept study is positive and carries great potential in the application of urban data analytics. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; London; Machine vision; Urban design,Computer vision; Convolution; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Neural networks; Quality control; Baseline models; Convolutional neural network; Learning models; London; Parameter-tuning; Proof of concept; Regional levels; Urban design; Image classification,,,,,"Alan Turing Institute; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/N510129/1)",This work was supported by The Alan Turing Institute under the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant no.

However, there is almost no information about how urban landscapes shape transmission dynamics in wildlife. Using an innovative phylodynamic approach combining host and pathogen molecular data with landscape characteristics and host traits, we untangle the complex factors that drive transmission networks of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in bobcats (Lynx rufus). We found that the urban landscape played a significant role in shaping FIV transmission. Even though bobcats were often trapped within the urban matrix, FIV transmission events were more likely to occur in areas with more natural habitat elements. Urban fragmentation also resulted in lower rates of pathogen evolution, possibly owing to a narrower range of host genotypes in the fragmented area. Combined, our findings show that urban landscapes can have impacts on a pathogen and its evolution in a carnivore living in one of the most fragmented and urban systems in North America. The analytical approach used here can be broadly applied to other host–pathogen systems, including humans. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",bobcat; disease biology; feline immunodeficiency virus; fragmentation; machine learning; phylodynamics,"animal; Bayes theorem; biological model; California; ecosystem; Feline immunodeficiency virus; gene flow; genetics; Lentivirus infection; Lynx; molecular evolution; phylogeny; spatial analysis; transmission; urbanization; virology; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Bayes Theorem; Ecosystem; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Flow; Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline; Lentivirus Infections; Los Angeles; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Spatial Analysis; Urbanization","GENBANK: JN383436:JN383465, JN383436, JN383465",,,,"(EF 0723676/DEB 1413925); Division of Environmental Biology, DEB, (DEB 1413925); Division of Environmental Biology, DEB; University of Minnesota, UM","Funding text 1: This project was funded by two National Science Foundation Ecology of Infectious Diseases research programme grants (EF 0723676/DEB 1413925).

Next to traditional, patch-based metrics used in landscape ecology, alternative metrics are proposed, measuring the presence and the spatial arrangement of built-up and open space areas along a set of radial transects, along contours parallel to the urban block boundary and along the block's perimeter, as well as metrics describing the internal composition of the built-up area. Use of the proposed metrics for identifying different types of urban form and function was tested on the Brussels Capital Region. Large-scale vector data was used to define built-up structures and to analyse the morphological properties of the built-up area at block level. Decision tree classification was applied in conjunction with bootstrap aggregation to gain insight in the distinctive character of the defined metrics, and the robustness of land use and urban form classification based on these metrics. Our study points out the shortcomings of traditional landscape ecological metrics for mapping urban form and emphasizes the need for alternative approaches for analysing urban landscapes, more explicitly describing the morphological characteristics of the urban fabric. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Brussels Capital Region; Land use; Machine learning; Spatial metrics; Urban form; Urban function,Decision trees; Ecology; Land use; Learning systems; Mapping; Brussels Capital Region; Decision tree classification; Internal composition; Morphological characteristic; Morphological properties; Spatial arrangements; Spatial metrics; Urban form; Structures (built objects); analytical method; building; land use; landscape ecology; machine learning; mapping; open space; spatial analysis; transect; urban area; urban design; urban morphology; Belgium; Brussels [Belgium],,,,,,,"Barnsley, Michael J., Distinguishing urban land-use categories in fine spatial resolution land-cover data using a graph-based, structural pattern recognition system, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 21, 3-4, pp. 209-225, (1997); Sustainable Urban and Regional Planning the Moland Activities on Urban Scenario Modelling and Forecast, (2003); Urban Building Blocks, (2008); Canters, Frank, Land-use simulation as a supporting tool for flood risk assessment and coastal safety planning: The case of the Belgian coast, Ocean and Coastal Management, 101, PB, pp. 102-113, (2014); Cavalli, Rosa Maria, Hyperspectral sensor data capability for retrieving complex urban land cover in comparison with multispectral data: Venice city case study (Italy), Sensors, 8, 5, pp. 3299-3320, (2008); Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest, (2009); Lu, Dengsheng, Impervious surface mapping with quickbird imagery, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 32, 9, pp. 2519-2533, (2011); undefined, (2008); undefined, (2014); Heiden, Uta, Urban structure type characterization using hyperspectral remote sensing and height information, Landscape and Urban Planning, 105, 4, pp. 361-375, (2012)","S.

Though, adequate algorithms need to cope with increasing data dimensionality, high redundancy between individual bands, and often spectrally complex urban landscapes. The study focuses on subpixel quantification of urban land cover compositions using simulated environmental mapping and analysis program (EnMAP) data acquired over the city of Berlin, utilizing both machine learning regression and classification algorithms, i.e., multioutput support vector regression (MSVR), standard support vector regression (SVR), import vector machine classifier (IVM), and support vector classifier (SVC). The experimental setup incorporates a spectral library and a reference land cover fraction map used for validation purposes. The library spectra were synthetically mixed to derive quantitative training data for the classes vegetation, impervious surface, soil, and water. MSVR and SVR models were trained directly using the synthetic mixtures. For IVM and SVC, a modified hyperparameter selection approach is conducted to improve the description of urban land cover fractions by means of probability outputs. Validation results demonstrate the high potential of the MSVR for subpixel mapping in the urban context. MSVR outperforms SVR in terms of both accuracy and computational time. IVM and SVC work similarly well, yet with lower accuracies of subpixel fraction estimates compared to both regression approaches. © 2017 IEEE.",Import vector machine (IVM); Machine learning; Multioutput support vector regression (MSVR); Subpixel; Support vector classifier (SVC); Support vector regression (SVR); Urban,Learning systems; Mapping; Pixels; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Static Var compensators; Vectors; Classification algorithm; Environmental mapping; Hyperspectral remote sensing data; Import vector machines; Multi-output support vector regressions; Support vector classifiers; Support vector regression (SVR); Urban characteristics; Data flow analysis; algorithm; land cover; pixel; remote sensing; satellite data; support vector machine; topographic mapping; urban area; vector autoregression; Spring viremia of carp virus,,,,,,,"World Urbanization Prospects the 2003 Revision, (2014); Kareiva, Peter M., Domesticated nature: Shaping landscapes and ecosystems for human welfare, Science, 316, 5833, pp. 1866-1869, (2007); Brabec, Elizabeth A., Impervious surfaces and water quality: A review of current literature and its implications for watershed planning, Journal of Planning Literature, 16, 4, pp. 499-514, (2002); Oke, Timothy R., City size and the urban heat island, Atmospheric Environment, 7, 8, pp. 769-779, (1973); Weng, Qihao, Remote sensing of impervious surfaces in the urban areas: Requirements, methods, and trends, Remote Sensing of Environment, 117, pp. 34-49, (2012); Ridd, Merrill K., Exploring a V-I-S (Vegetation-impervious surface-soil) model for urban ecosystem analysis through remote sensing: Comparative anatomy for citiest, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 16, 12, pp. 2165-2185, (1995); Mitraka, Zina, Nonlinear Spectral Unmixing of Landsat Imagery for Urban Surface Cover Mapping, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 9, 7, pp. 3340-3350, (2016); Powell, Rebecca L., Sub-pixel mapping of urban land cover using multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis: Manaus, Brazil, Remote Sensing of Environment, 106, 2, pp. 253-267, (2007); Roberts, Dar A., Synergies between VSWIR and TIR data for the urban environment: An evaluation of the potential for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) Decadal Survey mission, Remote Sensing of Environment, 117, pp. 83-101, (2012); Ben-Dor, Eyal, A spectral based recognition of the urban environment using the visible and near-infrared spectral region (0.4-1.1 µm).

Applying three suitability layers of environmental risk (soil erosion, flood risk, fire risk, and land susceptibility), urbanization potential, and integrated surface (environmental risk plus urbanization potential layers), a non-path-dependent Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-MC) model was configured to execute three scenarios of polycentric urban growth allocation. Specifically, the modeling approach improved the traditional functionality of the CA-MC model from a prediction algorithm into an innovative land allocation tool. Besides, due to its flexibility, the non-path-dependent model was able to explicitly include different characteristics of the landscape structure ranging from physical land attributes to landscape functions and processes (natural hazards). Accordingly, three polycentric urban growth allocation efforts were undertaken and compared in terms of connectivity and compactness of the resultant patterns and consumption of other land resources. Based on results, the polycentric allocation procedure based on integrated suitability layer produced a more manageable pattern of urban landscape, while the growth option based on environmental risk layer was more successful for protecting farmlands against excessive urbanization. This study suggests that polycentric urban land-use planning under the strategy of rural land development programs is an available option for designing an urban landscape with lower exposure to natural hazards and more economic benefits to rural residents. Finally, the non-path-dependent modeling is a recommended approach, when highly flexible and interactive decision-support systems as well as trend-breaking scenarios are desired. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Cellular Automata-Markov Chain model; Environmental risk management; Iran; Non-path-dependent modeling; Polycentric urban land-use planning; Urban growth modeling,Artificial intelligence; Cellular automata; Chains; Decision support systems; Economics; Environmental management; Floods; Hazards; Land use; Markov processes; Risk management; Risk perception; Structure (composition); Environmental risk managements; Iran; Markov chain models; Urban growth modeling; Urban land use; Urban growth; cellular automaton; environmental management; environmental risk; land use planning; Markov chain; risk assessment; urban area; urban growth; urbanization; agricultural land; decision support system; exposure; human; landscape; physical model; prediction; risk management; rural area; rural population; soil erosion; algorithm; city planning; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; fire; flooding; geographic mapping; risk; spatiotemporal analysis; Golestan; Gorgan; Algorithms; City Planning; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Geographic Mapping; Markov Chains; Risk; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Urbanization,,,,,,,"Adab, Hamed, Modeling forest fire risk in the northeast of Iran using remote sensing and GIS techniques, Natural Hazards, 65, 3, pp. 1723-1743, (2013); Afrakhteh, Roshanak, Evaluating the strategy of integrated urban-rural planning system and analyzing its effects on land surface temperature in a rapidly developing region, Habitat International, 56, pp. 147-156, (2016); Environmental Futures the Practice of Environmental Scenario Analysis, (2008); Jabbarian Amiri, Bahman, Introducing landscape accuracy metric for spatial performance evaluation of land use/land cover change models, Geocarto International, 32, 11, pp. 1171-1187, (2017); Antrop, Marc, Landscape change and the urbanization process in Europe, Landscape and Urban Planning, 67, 1-4, pp. 9-26, (2004); Asgarian, Ali, Assessing the effect of green cover spatial patterns on urban land surface temperature using landscape metrics approach, Urban Ecosystems, 18, 1, pp. 209-222, (2015); Brown, Daniel G., Path dependence and the validation of agent-based spatial models of land use, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 19, 2, pp. 153-174, (2005); Burby, Raymond J., Creating hazard resilient communities through land-use planning, Natural Hazards Review, 1, 2, pp. 99-106, (2000); Carruthers, John I., The American Way of Land Use: A Spatial Hazard Analysis of Changes Through Time, International Regional Science Review, 35, 3, pp. 267-302, (2012); Clarke, Keith C., A self-modifying cellular automaton model of historical urbanization in the San Francisco Bay area, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 24, 2, pp. 247-261, (1997)","Y.

For eco-district design, policy makers require decision support tools for integration of local environment issues with building design. In a first approach we analyse main environmental parameters that impact building energy performances and open-space thermal comfort. This is a key issue considering the local urban heat island impacts on energy and health. The urban area Cité Descartes is located in Paris suburbs (France) and has been selected in the French eco-district program. One objective is to renew the surroundings of a local train station that separates a low-income residential area and a business district. The study focuses on the central block of buildings covering a total area of 120,200 m2. The objective of the study is to evaluate main micrometeorological parameters influencing thermal comfort and building energy efficiency in the selected urban scenes; e.g. the wind flow patterns highlight discomfort zones for winter and summer periods. Finally, numerical simulations tools are used to underline the spatial and temporal variability of urban states which makes both difficult the analysis of one urban design and the decision process between several urban cooling strategies. The perspectives to develop new decision support indicators for energy and environmental performance are reviewed and proposed to develop both necessary simulation tools and decision support systems. © © NCEUB 2017.",Cool materials; Coupled simulationplatforms; PassiveCooling; UHI mitigation; UrbanIndicators,Architectural design; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Environmental management; Forestry; Numerical models; Thermal comfort; Building energy efficiency; Building energy performance; Decision support tools; Environmental parameter; Environmental performance; Local environments; Spatial and temporal variability; Urban heat island; Energy efficiency,,,,,,,"Bozonnet, Emmanuel, Thermal behaviour of buildings: Modelling the impact of urban heat island, Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology (New Series), 14, SUPPL., pp. 19-22, (2007); Chrysoulakis, Nektarios, Sustainable urban metabolism as a link between bio-physical sciences and urban planning: The BRIDGE project, Landscape and Urban Planning, 112, 1, pp. 100-117, (2013); French Thermal Building Regulation Rt2012 Arrete Du 26 Octobre 2010 Relatif Aux Caracteristiques Thermiques Et Aux Exigences De De Batiments, (2010); Low Carbon District Energy and Behavior Modeling, (2013); Gros, Adrien, Cool materials impact at district scale - Coupling building energy and microclimate models, Sustainable Cities and Society, 13, pp. 254-266, (2014); Gros, Adrien, A New Performance Indicator to Assess Building and District Cooling Strategies, Procedia Engineering, 169, pp. 117-124, (2016); Miguet, Francis, Urban bioclimatic indicators for urban planers with the software tool SOLENE, pp. 348-355, (2007); Evaluation and Development of Indicators for Sustainability Assessments of Urban Neighbourhood Renovation Projects, (2014); Riederer, Peter, Development of a simulation platform for the evaluation of district energy system performances, pp. 2499-2506, (2015); Santamouris, Matthaios J., Local urban warming, possible impacts and a resilience plan to climate change for the historical center of Athens, Greece, Sustainable Cities and Society, 19, pp. 281-291, (2015)",,"Brotas, L.; Roaf, S.; Nicol, F.",NCEUB 2017 - Network for Comfort and Energy Use in Buildings,AES Solar; Bennetts Associates; Historic Environment Scotland; VELUX,"33rd International on Passive and Low Energy Architecture Conference: Design to Thrive, PLEA 2017",2017-07-02 through 2017-07-05,Edinburgh,159932,,9.78E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Under present day conditions, the identities of cities are rapidly deteriorating and vanishing. Therefore, the importance of urban design, which is a means of designing urban spaces and their physical and social aspects, is ever growing. This paper proposes a novel methodology by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering approach to find important features of the urban identity from public space. K. Lynch's work and Space Syntax theory are reconstructed and integrated with POI (Points of Interest) to quantify the quality of the public space. A case study of Zürich city is used to test of these redefinitions and features of urban identity. The results show that PCA and K-means clustering approach can identify the urban identity and explore important features. This strategy could help to improve planning and design processes and generation of new urban patterns with more appropriate features and qualities. © 2017 IEEE.",Feature extraction; K-means clustering; Space syntax; Urban identity,Extraction; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Research laboratories; Social aspects; Syntactics; Urban planning; Important features; Novel methodology; Planning and design; Points of interest; Principle component analysis; Space syntax; Space syntax theory; Urban identity; K-means clustering,,,,,,,"Eben Saleh, Mohammed Abdullah, The integration of tradition and modernity: a search for an urban and architectural identity in Arriyadhl, the capital of Saudi Arabia, Habitat International, 22, 4, pp. 571-589, (1998); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2012); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2012); Hull, R.

Application of these techniques helps in assessing the significance of causal factors on spatial events. This work attempts to identify the hotspots of possible randomness in terms of land use / cover changes using machine learning and remote sensing techniques. Transformations in an urban landscape pattern are a consequence of congregation of different spatial and aspatial factors. Furthermore, there is a huge possibility that the characteristics of these factors may vary in spatio-temporal domain. Hence, it is difficult to investigate an urban event using a unidimensional approach. Non-linearity of urban events can be tackled using techniques which are effective in considering and representing the possible transitions of causal factors from one state to another with probabilistic / possibilistic values. Hence, Bayesian model is employed in this study using historical and current data sets. Firstly, the study area is segregated into different grids. Spatiotemporal assessment of land use / cover changes and transition of LULC class from one to another is performed for the years between 1992 and 2014 for each grid. Then, current landscape pattern is quantified using a proposed landscape indices termed as fuzzy -Shannon’s heterogeneity index for different grids. It is developed by modifying conventional Shannon’s heterogeneity index. The results obtained from the application of fuzzy-Shannon’s heterogeneity indexand spatiotemporal assessment of LULC changes and transition of LULC class from one to another are fed into the Bayesian model to determine the land use / cover changes hotspots. Results of the Bayesian model a lso help in identifying the factors which are the most significant actors in inducing randomness in LULC transformation. Hotspots obtained from the proposed model are witnessing unprecedented changes in LULC. Therefore, it can be inferred that results are in sync with the actual scenario. © 2017 ACRS.

These decisions can be assisted by different approaches ranging from linear depreciation for estimating the economic value of the network over using a deterioration model to assess the probability of failure or the technical service life to sophisticated multi-criteria decision support systems. Subsequently, the aim of this paper is to compare five available multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods (ELECTRE, AHP, WSM, TOPSIS, and PROMETHEE) for the application in an integrated rehabilitation management scheme for a real world case study and analyze them with respect to their suitability to be used in integrated asset management of water systems. The results of the different methods are not equal. This occurs because the chosen score scales, weights and the resulting distributions of the scores within the criteria do not have the same impact on all the methods. Independently of the method used, the decision maker must be familiar with its strengths but also weaknesses. Therefore, in some cases, it would be rational to use one of the simplest methods. However, to check for consistency and increase the reliability of the results, the application of several methods is encouraged. © 2017 by the authors.",AHP; Asset management; Decision support; ELECTRE; Multi-utility rehabilitation; PROMETHEE; TOPSIS; Urban water infrastructure; WSM,Artificial intelligence; Asset management; Decision support systems; Hierarchical systems; Scales (weighing instruments); Water management; Decision supports; Electre; PROMETHEE; TOPSIS; Urban waters; Decision making; decision making; decision support system; distribution system; future prospect; infrastructure; integrated approach; multicriteria analysis; prioritization; urban design; urban planning; water management; water planning; water supply,,,,,,,"European Standard En 752 Drain and Sewer Systems Outside Buildings, (2008); European Standard En 805 Water Supply Requirements for Systems and Components Outside Buildings, (2000); Casillas, Myrna V., Optimal sensor placement for leak location in water distribution networks using evolutionary algorithms, Water (Switzerland), 7, 11, pp. 6496-6515, (2015); Sörensen, Johanna Lykke, Re-thinking urban flood management-time for a regime shift, Water (Switzerland), 8, 8, (2016); Care S Computer Aided Rehabilitation of Sewer and Storm Water Networks, (2006); Yoo, Do Guen, Rehabilitation priority determination of water pipes based on hydraulic importance, Water (Switzerland), 6, 12, pp. 3864-3887, (2014); Osman, Hesham M., Coordination of urban infrastructure reconstruction projects, Structure and Infrastructure Engineering, 12, 1, pp. 108-121, (2016); Tscheikner-Gratl, Franz, Integrated rehabilitation planning of urban infrastructure systems using a street section priority model, Urban Water Journal, 13, 1, pp. 28-40, (2016); Tscheikner-Gratl, Franz, Integrated rehabilitation management by prioritization of rehabilitation areas for small and medium sized municipalities, pp. 2045-2057, (2015); Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras, State of art surveys of overviews on MCDM/MADM methods, Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 20, 1, pp. 165-179, (2014)","F.

In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and ""interpretability"". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of ""regional centers"" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Amenities; Land use; Public transit; Urban planning,decision making; demand analysis; land use planning; public transport; urban design; urban planning,,,,,-1224504056,This research was supported by Singapore A * SERC Complex Systems Programme research grant ( 1224504056 ).

The recent advances in sensor technologies and digitization have produced a wealth of data to help research activities by facilitating improved measurements and conducting large scale analysis. This paper explores the potential of big data and big data analytics in the light of current approaches to measuring streetscape features. By applying machine learning algorithms on Google Street View imagery, we generated objectively three measures on visual enclosure. The results showed that sky areas were identified fairly well for the calculation of proportion of sky. The three visual enclosure measures were found to be correlated with pedestrian volume and Walk Score. This method allows large scale and consistent objective measures of visual enclosure that can be done reproducibly and universally applicable with readily available Google Street View imagery in many countries around the world to help test their association with walking behaviors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Enclosure; Machine learning; Street design features; Walkability,algorithm; data set; machine learning; satellite imagery; travel behavior; walking; World Wide Web,,,,,,,"Badland, Hannah M., Can virtual streetscape audits reliably replace physical streetscape audits?, Journal of Urban Health, 87, 6, pp. 1007-1016, (2010); Boer, Rob, Neighborhood Design and Walking Trips in Ten U.S. Metropolitan Areas, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 32, 4, pp. 298-304, (2007); Urban Design Reader, (2007); Clarke, Philippa J., Using Google Earth to conduct a neighborhood audit: Reliability of a virtual audit instrument, Health and Place, 16, 6, pp. 1224-1229, (2010); Measuring Urban Design Qualities an Illustrated Field Manual, (2005); Applied Multiple Regression Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1983); Proceedings 3rd International Space Syntax Symposium, (2001); Duncan, Dustin T., Validation of Walk Score® for estimating neighborhood walkability: An analysis of four US metropolitan areas, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 8, 11, pp. 4160-4179, (2011); Ewing, Reid H., Travel and the built environment, Journal of the American Planning Association, 76, 3, pp. 265-294, (2010); Ewing, Reid H., Measuring urban design: Metrics for livable places, pp. 1-183, (2013)","L.

When infested by the RPW, all untreated palms typically die. RPW monitoring is difficult, and when the pest is detected, management to save the infested palm becomes intricate. For this reason, an efficient and integrated RPW monitoring, such as a location-aware system (LAS), combined with the scientific knowledge of experts on the palm's physiology and the RPW biological cycle must be designed, developed and implemented. In the current study, an innovative integrated RPW management in urban landscapes under real conditions is presented. Based on the LAS, this study investigates the effectiveness of monitoring RPW infestations in palms, such as the Phoenix canariensis, under field conditions at the Pedion Areos park, which is located in central Athens, the capital of the Hellenic Republic. The goal of this study is to address the specific needs of RPW management and control by facilitating the treatment process adopted by experts combined with an appropriate spatial decision support system (SDSS), which accounts for the RPW population dynamics and spatio-temporal characteristics of the infested areas. The process of estimating the infestation risk is based on a ten-point scale classification, which is incorporated into the LAS. The results from the aforementioned moderate-scaled field experiment conducted for evaluation purposes showed that the LAS is an innovative, simple, and easy to use integrated platform that can be used for early detection, rapid monitoring and assessment of RPW in urban landscapes. Finally, the results from this four-year experiment showed that the diameter and height of the trunk of canary palms play a significant role in the susceptibility to RPW infestations and the recovery of infested canary palms; the results also demonstrated that control of RPW in urban landscapes is possible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Location-aware system; Mobile GIS; Red palm weevil; Spatial decision support system,Animals; Artificial intelligence; Risk perception; Integrated management; Location aware system; Management and controls; Mobile GIS; Red palm weevil; Scientific knowledge; Spatial decision support systems; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Decision support systems; beetle; decision support system; GIS; integrated approach; invasive species; pest control; population dynamics; urban system; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece; Coleoptera; Curculionidae; Phoenix canariensis; Rhynchophorus ferrugineus,,,,,"(289566); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (FP7 KBBE 2011-5-289566)",This research received funding from the European Community\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement No. FP7 KBBE 2011-5-289566 (PALM PROTECT).,"Cohen, Yafit, Spatial decision support system for Medfly control in citrus, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 62, 2, pp. 107-117, (2008); undefined; Dembilio, Óscar, Basic bio-ecological parameters of the invasive Red Palm Weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in phoenix canariensis under mediterranean climate, Bulletin of Entomological Research, 101, 2, pp. 153-163, (2011); Dembilio, Óscar, Bio-ecology and integrated management of the red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in the region of Valencia (Spain), Hellenic Plant Protection Journal, 5, 1, pp. 1-12, (2012); Dynamic Mobile GIS Investigating Change in Space and Time, (2006); Bulletin Oepp EPPO Bulletin, (2008); Esrigis Mapping Software Solutions Services Map Apps and Data; International Journal of Tropical Insect Science, (2006); Faleiro, Jose Romeno, Spatial distribution of red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Oliv.

This will create unprecedented opportunities for a variety of environmental research fields and lead to manifold novel applications. These opportunities specifically apply to challenging environments, including heterogeneous urban landscapes. In this paper, we explored the potential of EnMAP data for quantifying land cover along the urban-rural gradient of Berlin, Germany. Land cover fraction maps from a simulated EnMAP scene at 30. m spatial resolution were derived based on support vector regression (SVR) combined with synthetically mixed training data. Results demonstrate that EnMAP imagery will be well suited for mapping impervious, vegetation and soil surface types according to the VIS framework. Moreover, EnMAP data will allow extending the VIS framework by more detailed sub-categories such as roof and pavement, or low vegetation and tree. However, we advise caution that spaceborne imaging spectrometer data of improved quality will not completely help to overcome well known phenomena of spectral similarity between materials and spectral confusion caused by the presence of shaded areas. To identify possible benefits and limitations of EnMAP data, comparisons to fraction maps derived from a higher resolution Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) image at 9. m spatial resolution and a multispectral Landsat ETM. +-like image at 30. m spatial resolution were drawn. First, we demonstrate that both VIS and extended VIS mapping reveal similar accuracies compared to maps from spatially higher resolution data. Second, we illustrate the superiority of the higher spectral information content for improved and extended urban land cover mapping compared to multispectral data. Overall, this study provides important insights into the potential of spaceborne imaging spectrometer and specifically future EnMAP data for urban remote sensing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",EnMAP; Hyperspectral; Imaging spectrometry; Sub-pixel mapping; Support vector regression (SVR); Urban-rural gradient; VIS model,Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Image resolution; Learning systems; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Rural areas; Spectrometers; Vegetation; EnMAP; HyperSpectral; Imaging spectrometry; Sub-pixel mapping; Support vector regression (SVR); Urban-rural gradients; Trees (mathematics); data set; Landsat; mapping; numerical model; pixel; rural area; satellite mission; spatial resolution; spectrometry; urban area; vegetation; Berlin; Germany,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (FKZ 50EE0949, HO 2568/2-2); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi","The authors thank the German Aerospace Centre for the data acquisition and pre-processing during the HyEurope 2009 Campaign, Karl Segl and Christian Rogaß from the German Research Center for Geosciences for the data simulations and the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development for providing the data from the Urban and Environmental Information System.

In this paper we outline the on-going research that seeks for a reliable metrics to evaluate the characteristics of built environments in terms of its efficiency and performance on the level of neighborhoods. Specifically, the research develops the evaluation model for Slovenian neighborhood, based on the modular system of indicators and to it connected methodology for the interpretation of resulting values. The envisioned instrument evaluates sustainability performance through five crucial categories: energy efficiency, environmental efficiency, efficient organization and management of the built environment, communities' engagement level, and exploitation of ICT smart solutions to foster other four categories of efficiency. Each of the category is observed from the aspect of three strategic levels of implementation: (1) buildings or households, (2) public and in-between spaces, (3) traffic organization and infrastructure. Such structuring introduces possibilities for evaluating neighborhoods from environmental aspects, built environment characteristics, appearances and functionalities, as well as activities, habits and socio-demographic structure of their inhabitants - all being crucial factors in achieving better performance and efficiency of cities and their parts. © 2015 AEIT.",Assessment methods; Decision-making support; Neighbourhood performance; Sustainable retrofitting; Urban design,Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Retrofitting; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Assessment methods; Decision making support; Energy efficiency policies; Environmental efficiency; Neighbourhood; Organization and management; Sustainability performance; Urban design; Energy efficiency,,,,,,,"Transition to Sustainable Buildings Strategies and Opportunities to 2050, (2013); A Roadmap for Moving to A Competitive Low Carbon Economy in 2050, (2011); Rehva Journal, (2012); Tomozeiu, Daniel, Adapting adaptation: The English eco-town initiative as governance process, Ecology and Society, 19, 2, (2014); Lombardi, Patrizia L., Beyond energy efficiency in evaluating sustainable development in planning and the built environment, International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology and Urban Development, 4, 4, pp. 274-282, (2013); Weather Matters for Energy, (2014); Policy Paper on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency of Residential Housing, (2011); Barton, Hugh, Eco-neighbourhoods: a review of projects, Local Environment, 3, 2, pp. 159-177, (1998); Stockholm Ivl Swedish Environmental, (2014); Svetina, Matija, Beliefs about the environment: Moving from the egocentric towards the ecocentric perspective, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 21, 6, pp. 540-545, (2014)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"AEIT International Annual Conference: A Sustainable Development in the Mediterranean Area, AEIT 2015",2015-10-14 through 2015-10-16,Naples,119506,,9.79E+12,,,English,"AEIT Int.

As in all eddy covariance studies, obtaining annual sums of urban CO<inf>2</inf> exchange requires imputation of data gaps due to low turbulence and non-stationary conditions, adverse weather, and instrument failures. Gap-filling approaches that are widely used for measurements from towers in natural vegetation are based on light and temperature response models. However, they do not account for key features of the urban environment including tower footprint heterogeneity and localized CO<inf>2</inf> sources. Here, we present a novel gap-filling modeling framework that uses machine learning to select explanatory variables, such as continuous traffic counts and temporal variables, and then constrains models separately for spatially classified subsets of the data. We applied the modeling framework to a three year time series of measurements from a tall broadcast tower in a suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA. The gap-filling performance was similar to that reported for natural measurement sites, explaining 64% to 88% of the variability in the fluxes. Simulated carbon budgets were in good agreement with an ecophysiological bottom-up study at the same site. Total annual carbon dioxide flux sums for the tower site ranged from 1064 to 1382gCm-2yr-1, across different years and different gap-filling methods. Bias errors of annual sums resulting from gap-filling did not exceed 18gCm-2yr-1 and random uncertainties did not exceed ±44gCm-2yr-1 (or ±3.8% of the annual flux). Regardless of the gap-filling method used, the year-to-year differences in carbon exchange at this site were small. In contrast, the modeled annual sums of CO<inf>2</inf> exchange differed by a factor of two depending on wind direction. This indicated that the modeled time series captured the spatial variability in both the biogenic and anthropogenic CO<inf>2</inf> sources and sinks in a reproducible way. The gap-filling approach developed here may also be useful for inhomogeneous sites other than urban areas, such as logged forests or ecosystems under disturbance from fire or pests. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Carbon dioxide; Eddy covariance; Gap-filling; Machine learning; Spatial heterogeneity; Uncertainty; Urban ecosystem,Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Filling; Learning systems; Random errors; Time series; Towers; Eddy covariance; Gap filling; Spatial heterogeneity; Uncertainty; Urban ecosystem; Urban growth; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; disturbance; ecophysiology; eddy covariance; error analysis; heterogeneity; source-sink dynamics; spatial variation; uncertainty analysis; urban ecosystem; Article; carbon footprint; error; explanatory variable; landscape; machine learning; seasonal variation; time; time series analysis; United States; urban area; Minneapolis; Minnesota; Saint Paul,,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,"Earth Sciences Division, (NNG04GN80G); Earth Sciences Division","The KUOM flux study was funded by a grant to J.P.M. from NASA Earth Science Division ( NNG04GN80G ), as a component of the North American Carbon Program (NACP).

The spatial arrangement of different building types creates varied urban land-use clusters which can provide an insight to understand the relationships between social, economic, and living spaces. The classification of such urban clusters can help in policy-making and resource management. In many countries including the UK no national-level cadastral database containing information on individual building types exists in public domain. In this paper, we present a framework for inferring functional types of buildings based on the analysis of their form (e.g. geometrical properties, such as area and perimeter, layout) and spatial relationship from large topographic and address-based GIS database. Machine learning algorithms along with exploratory spatial analysis techniques are used to create the classification rules. The classification is extended to two further levels based on the functions (use) of buildings derived from address-based data.

In the very dynamic era of Yogyakarta society today, advertisement undeniably has been becoming one of the essential components in modern urban landscape. However, inaccuracy of advertisement design conversely can emerge inconvenience and interruption for society. Again it can also lead to the decline of the urban visual quality. In this paper, a study on advertisement regulation in Yogyakarta is conducted using a descriptive-qualitative approach based on the analysis on the communication aspect and spatial aspect. The results are used in recommending for the advertisement regulation based on three criteria: aesthetics, ethics, and safety. Aesthetics is in consideration of cultural values suitable in Yogyakarta and visual consideration.

The primary vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) in Illinois are Culex pipiens Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) and Culex restuans Theobald. In urban environments, these mosquitoes commonly oviposit in roadside storm water catch basins. However, use of this habitat is inconsistent, with abundance of larvae varying significantly across catch basins at a fine spatial scale. Methods. We tested the hypothesis that attributes of the biotic and abiotic environment contribute to spatial and temporal variation in production of mosquito vectors, characterizing the relationship between terrestrial vegetation and aquatic chemistry and Culex abundance in Chicago, Illinois. Larvae were sampled from 60 catch basins from June 14 to October 3, 2009. Density of shrubs and 14 tree genera surrounding the basins were quantified, as well as aquatic chemistry content of each basin. Results: We demonstrate that the spatial pattern of Culex abundance in catch basins is strongly influenced by environmental characteristics, resulting in significant variation across the urban landscape. Using regression and machine learning techniques, we described landscape features and microhabitat characteristics of four Chicago neighborhoods and examined the implications of these measures for larval abundance in adjacent catch basins. The important positive predictors of high larval abundance were aquatic ammonia, nitrates, and area of shrubs of height <1 m surrounding the catch basins, whereas pH and area of flowering shrub were negatively correlated with larval abundance. Tree density, particularly of arborvitae, maple, and pear, also positively influenced the distribution of Culex during the fruit-bearing periods and early senescent periods in August and September. Conclusions: This study identifies environmental predictors of mosquito production in urban environments. Because an abundance of adult Culex is integral to efficient WNV transmission and mosquitoes are found in especially high densities near larval habitats, identifying aquatic sites for Culex and landscape features that promote larval production are important in predicting the spatial pattern of cases of human and veterinary illness. Thus, these data enable accurate assessment of regions at risk for exposure to WNV and aid in the prevention of vector-borne disease transmission. © 2013 Gardner et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Aquatic chemistry; Culex mosquitoes; Geographic information science; Landscape ecology; Larval habitat; Vegetation; West Nile virus,ammonia; nitrate; aquatic species; article; disease carrier; disease transmission; environmental factor; larva; maple syrup urine disease; microhabitat; mosquito; nonhuman; pear; pH; quantitative analysis; shrub; terrestrial species; United States; urban area; vegetation; virus transcription; West Nile flavivirus; Animals; Chicago; Culex; Ecosystem; Larva; Plant Development; Population Density; Water; Acer; Culex pipiens; Culex restuans; Culicidae; Diptera; Pyrus; Thuja; West Nile virus,,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrate, 14797-55-8; Water, 7732-18-5",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Science Foundation, NSF, (0840403); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (R37AI021884); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID","We thank Zach Allison, William Brown, Kelly DeBaene, Joanna Ganning, Diane Godhe, Patrick Kelly, and Timothy Thompson for assistance in collecting larval mosquitoes and microhabitat data and Ronald Weigel for advice on the statistical analysis.

A Dynamic Spatial Decision Support System was constructed to help identify the complex values characterizing a selected area in Naples' marginal urban landscape. The System consists of a set of selected indicators that represent the area's distinguishing characteristics with specific focus on its critical and potential factors. The formulation of spatial indicators helps identify the ecological, socio-economic and urban characteristics of the case-study area, along with their historic evolution over a specific time period. Time History Analysis (THA) enables the identification of permanent elements and transformations along with the relationships among the various urban landscape components over time. The synergistic interaction between the appropriately structured Geographic Information System (GIS) and the multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method help to generate a complex values map of the analyzed landscape to support the definition and location of strategic actions.

The fragmentation of urban landscape and built-in facilities may leave less large scale open spaces for developing patchy forests and green spaces. Therefore, the urban tree canopy is one of the best indictors for quantitively and qualitively assessing urban forest characteristics thus a primary measure for urban forest planning and management. As a result, many communities are adopting Urban tree canopy (UTC) goals to maintain and improve forest benefits. UTC is defined as precentage of the leaves, branches and stems of trees that cover the ground when viewed from above. It is therefore widely used for evaluating water quality improvement, energy saving, urban heat island mitigation, air pollution reduction, property values adding, wildlife habitat conservation, social and educational opportunities, and aesthetic benefits that urban tree and forest can provide. UTC is relatively easy to measure by remote sensing technology and less costly than field sampling. UTC is a comparable index across a city and among cities whatever the size of the area is measured. In addition, UTC is a good performance measure for detecting changes across space and time and an easy-to-understand concept for communicating between managers and the public. The present development of UTC studies and applications can be summarized as 1) the UTC researches have firmly related with the eco-construction,people's living and city management, 2) the high resolution images are broadly utilizated in UTC investigation and maping, 3) the Object-Based Image Analysis method and LIDAR technology are being applicated in the UTC research, and 4) the assistant artificial intelligence decision-making system will be popularized in the UTC construction and management.",Status and trend; Urban forest; Urban tree canopy (UTC),decision making; forest management; greenspace; habitat conservation; lidar; remote sensing; urbanization,,,,,,,"Antrop, Marc, Changing patterns in the urbanized countryside of Western Europe, Landscape Ecology, 15, 3, pp. 257-270, (2000); World Urbanization Prospects the 1996 Revision, (1998); World Urbanization Prospects the 2007 Revision, (2008); China Park, (2004); Journal of Arid Land Resources and Environment, (2006); Su, Weizhong, Ecological land fragmentation and its connectivity with urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta, Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica, 62, 12, pp. 1309-1317, (2007); Urban Environment and Urban Ecology, (2010); Cook, Edward A., Urban landscape networks: An ecological planning framework, Landscape Research, 16, 3, pp. 7-15, (1991); Nadenicek, Daniel Joseph, Nature in the city: Horace Cleveland's aesthetic, Landscape and Urban Planning, 26, 1-4, pp. 5-15, (1993); Mazzotti, Frank J., A scientific framework for managing urban natural areas, Landscape and Urban Planning, 38, 3-4, pp. 171-181, (1997)","B.

Golf courses, ornamental, 'Atlantic' gardens and swimming pools are the most striking artefacts of this transformation, threatening the local water supply systems and exacerbating water scarcity. In the face of climate change, urban landscape irrigation is becoming increasingly important from a resource management point of view. This paper adopts urban remote sensing towards a targeted mapping approach using machine learning techniques and highresolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) to generate GIS-ready information for urban water consumption studies. Swimming pools, vegetation and - as a subgroup of vegetation - turf grass are extracted as important determinants of water consumption. For image analysis, the complex nature of urban environments suggests spatial-spectral classification, i.e. the complementary use of the spectral signature and spatial descriptors. Multiscale image segmentation provides means to extract the spatial descriptors - namely object feature layers - which can be concatenated at pixel level to the spectral signature. This study assesses the value of object features using different machine learning techniques and amounts of labeled information for learning. The results indicate the benefit of the spatial-spectral approach if combined with appropriate classifiers like tree-based ensembles or support vector machines, which can handle high dimensionality. Finally, a Random Forest classifier was chosen to deliver the classified input data for the estimation of evaporative water loss and net landscape irrigation requirements. © 2012 SPIE.",Machine learning; Object-based feature extraction; Sustainable urban development; Water demand; WorldView-2,High resolution satellite imagery; Machine learning techniques; Multi-scale image segmentation; Object based; Random forest classifier; Sustainable urban development; Water demand; Worldview-2; Climate change; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Irrigation; Satellite imagery; Swimming pools; Vegetation; Water supply; Water supply systems; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Urban Sprawl in Europe the Ignored Challenge, (2006); Domene, Elena, Urbanisation and water consumption: Influencing factors in the metropolitan region of Barcelona, Urban Studies, 43, 9, pp. 1605-1623, (2006); Domene, Elena, Urbanization and sustainable resource use: The case of garden watering in the metropolitan region of Barcelona, Urban Geography, 26, 6, pp. 520-535, (2005); Iglesias, Ana, Challenges to manage the risk of water scarcity and climate change in the Mediterranean, Water Resources Management, 21, 5, pp. 775-788, (2007); Final Report Annex 4 Case Study Mediterranean Coast of Spain, (2011); International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, (2012); Vidal, Mercedes, Changing geographies of water-related consumption: Residential swimming pools in suburban Barcelona, Area, 43, 1, pp. 67-75, (2011); Wentz, Elizabeth A., Determinants of small-area water consumption for the City of Phoenix, Arizona, Water Resources Management, 21, 11, pp. 1849-1863, (2007); Water and Tourism Pilot Study, (2009); Gössling, Stefan, Tourism and water use: Supply, demand, and security.

The results of such an analysis can lead to improvements in urban design. However, a technical challenge arises when trying to determine the gaze direction of pedestrians recorded on video. High noise levels and the subtlety of human gaze dynamics hamper precise calculations. However, as robots can be programmed and analysed more efficiently than humans, this study uses them for developing and training a gaze analysis system with the aim to later apply it to human video data using the machine learning technique of manifold alignment. For this study, a laboratory was set up to become a model street scene in which autonomous humanoid robots of approximately 55cm in height simulate the behaviour of human pedestrians. The experiments compare the inputs from several cameras as the robot walks down the model street and changes its behaviour upon encountering visually attractive objects. Overhead recordings and the robot's internal joint signals are analysed after filtering to provide true data against which the recorded data can be compared for accuracy testing. A central component of the research is the calculation of a torus-like manifold that represents all the different three-dimensional (3D) head directions of a robot head and allows the ordering of extracted 3D gaze vectors obtained from video sequences. We briefly describe how the obtained multidimensional trajectory data can be analysed by using a temporal behaviour analysis technique based on support vector machines that was developed separately. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",gaze analysis; localization; manifold learning; pedestrians; robots; saliency; tracking,Gaze analysis; localization; Manifold learning; pedestrians; saliency; Anthropomorphic robots; Dynamics; Robots; Surface discharges; Three dimensional; Urban planning; Video recording; Behavioral research,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP1092679); Australian Research Council, ARC",This project was supported by ARC DP1092679 ‘Modelling and predicting patterns of pedestrian movement: using robotics and machine learning to improve the design of urban space’.

These impacts may affect the recharge of the upper Floridian aquifer. The advent of urban hydrology and remote sensing technologies opens new and innovative means to undertake eventbased assessment of ecohydrological effects in urban regions. For assessing these landfalls, the multispectral Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing images can be used for the estimation of such soil moisture change in connection with two other MODIS products - Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST). Supervised classification for soil moisture retrieval was performed for Tampa Bay area on the 2 kmx2km grid with MODIS images. Machine learning with genetic programming model for soil moisture estimation shows advances in image processing, feature extraction, and change detection of soil moisture. ET data that were derived by Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) data and hydrologic models can be retrieved from the USGS web site directly. Overall, the derived soil moisture in comparison with ET time series changes on a seasonal basis shows that spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture and ET that are confined within a defined region for each type of surfaces, showing clustered patterns and featuring space scatter plot in association with the land use and cover map. These concomitant soil moisture patterns and ET fluctuations vary among patches, plant species, and, especially, location on the urban gradient. Time series plots of LST in association with ET, soil moisture and EVI reveals unique ecohydrological trends. Such ecohydrological assessment can be applied for supporting the urban landscape management in hurricane-stricken regions. © 2011 SPIE.",Climate change; Coastal watershed; Ecohydrology; Remote sensing; Urban sustainability,Change detection; Coastal watersheds; Complex Processes; Ecohydrology; Enhanced vegetation index; Event-based; Geostationary operational environmental satellites; Hydrologic models; Land surface temperature; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-spectral; Plant species; Remote sensing images; Remote sensing technology; Scatter plots; Soil moisture estimation; Soil moisture retrievals; Soil-vegetation; Spatial and temporal variation; Spatiotemporal patterns; Supervised classification; Tampa Bay; Thermal cycle; Urban hydrology; Urban landscape; Urban regions; Urban sustainability; Urban watershed; Water and energies; Aquifers; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospherics; Climate change; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Feature extraction; Genetic programming; Geostationary satellites; Image reconstruction; Innovation; Mathematical models; Plants (botany); Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil moisture; Space optics; Sustainable development; Time series; Water supply; Watersheds; Geologic models,,,,,,,"Adger, W.

We know only little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis. In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can support the bees. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Citizen science; Solitary bees; Spatial distribution; Sun exposure; Trap nest; Urban landscape structure,Ecosystems; Logistic regression; Spatial distribution; Citizen science; Solitary bees; Sun exposures; Trap nest; Urban landscape; Urban growth; abundance; artificial nest; bee; biotope; GIS; habitat selection; habitat type; pollination; regression analysis; resource availability; spatial distribution; trap (equipment); urban area; wild population; Germany; Leipzig; Saxony; Apoidea; Hymenoptera; Megachilidae; Osmia; Osmia rufa,,,,,"European Commission, EC, (FP6-036921, GOCE-CT-2003-506675); Helmholtz Association, (VH-NG 247)","We thank the participating volunteers for trap-nest placing and returning and for completing the questionnaire.

A software system was developed to analyse the dynamics of pedestrians with a focus on their movement trajectories and the angle between the pedestrian's movement vector and their gaze vector. One-class support vector machines and dynamic time warping were applied for outlier detection in order to indentify noticeable changes in the visual behavior of individuals in a group of simulated pedestrians who walk past visually attractive objects. Results of simulation experiments demonstrate how different pedestrian behaviour characteristics can be detected and distinguished in a variety of abstract urban design scenarios. The described software system was designed to allow future real world applications by feeding video recordings of real pedestrians into the model.,,Behaviour analysis; Body dynamics; Dynamic time warping; Intelligent evaluation; Movement trajectories; Movement vector; New approaches; One-class support vector machine; Outlier Detection; Real-world application; Simulation experiments; Software systems; Urban design; Urban environments; Visual behavior; Artificial intelligence; Atmospheric movements; Computer software; Video recording; Behavioral research,,,,,,,"Gandhi, Tarak L., Pedestrian collision avoidance systems: A survey of computer vision based recent studies, pp. 976-981, (2006); Kelly, Philip, Robust pedestrian detection and tracking in crowded scenes, Image and Vision Computing, 27, 10, pp. 1445-1458, (2009); Pai, Chiajung, Pedestrian detection and tracking at crossroads, IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, 2, pp. 101-104, (2003); Kelly, Philip, Pedestrian detection in uncontrolled environments using stereo and biometric information, Proceedings of the ACM International Multimedia Conference and Exhibition, pp. 161-170, (2006); Sánchez-Orellana, Pedro Luis, Bio-inspired architecture for visual recognition of humans walking, Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing, 61 AISC, pp. 443-452, (2009); Kanda, Takayuki, Who will be the customer?: A social robot that anticipates people's behavior from their trajectories, pp. 380-389, (2008); Proceedings of Museums and the Web, (2002); Broggi, Alberto, Localization and analysis of critical areas in urban scenarios, IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, Proceedings, pp. 1074-1079, (2008); Yue, Hao, Study on Moving Pedestrian Tracking Based on Video Sequences, Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology, 7, 4, pp. 47-51, (2007); Hua, Chunsheng, A general framework for tracking people, 2006, pp. 511-516, (2006)","A.

Remote sensing can reveal spatio-temporal growth trajectories of cities, which again allow a thorough understanding of the impacts of urbanization on ecosystems and ecosystem services. However, the mapping of urban areas remains one of the most challenging tasks of remote sensing data analysis. This paper presents an approach to map urban growth from multi-sensoral data, exemplified for the Dhaka megacity region in Bangladesh between 1990 and 2006. The approach is globally applicable and can facilitate regional urban growth maps in arbitrary complex and dynamic environments. Dhaka's densified urban landscape, its deltaic locality and the highly dynamic monsoon-related phenology call for a sophisticated analysis approach that is able to separate intra-annual land-cover variations from actual urbanization. Imagery from the Landsat series of satellites is a great asset for such an analysis due to its synoptic coverage of large urban areas as well as its unique historical archives. In our approach, we solve problems of spectral ambiguities and seasonal phenological dynamics through incorporating multi-temporal imagery for each monitoring year (1990, 2000, and 2006) and by extending the spectral feature space with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The resulting datasets are heterogeneous and comprise measurements of unequal scaling. Non-parametric classification algorithms are required to delineate multi-modal and non-Gaussian class distributions of heterogeneous as well as temporally and spectrally complex land-cover classes of interest in such an extended feature space. We therefore used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and post classification comparison to reveal spatio-temporal patterns of urban land-use and land-cover changes. An SVM based forward feature selection procedure allowed deriving in-depth information about the individual contribution of different input bands. Our methodology delineated relevant land-cover classes and resulted in overall accuracies better than 83% for all years considered. Change analysis unveiled a profound expansion of urban areas at the expense of prime agricultural areas and wetlands. During the 1990s, change was primarily characterized by a densification of urban fabric, whereas more recent changes included vast in-filling of low lying land and an extensive industrial sprawl into Dhaka's peri-urban areas. Our multi-sensoral and multi-temporal mapping approach allowed for delineating temporally dynamic LULCC, which again allowed for an insightful characterization of land system changes in the megacity region of Dhaka. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

From this analysis it is possible to identify some general trends. However, the selected tools represent a very diverse set with no common standards, varying in the background principles, the topics addressed and the outputs produced. Furthermore, the tools are largely specific to a specific geographic and institutional context and to a type of project, and for that reason the customisation of indicators and benchmarks is generally encouraged.

The concept of the Creative City, proposed by Charles Landry is driving the imagination of city redevelopers. It is essential for researchers to pay more attention to the issue of Creative City design for rethinking urban competitiveness. However, Creative City design must be supported with a wide range of knowledge and a diverse database. Concurrent city development requires to empower efficiency with appropriate evaluation and decision tools. Building a decision support system of Creative City development can help decision-makers to solve semi-structured problems by analyzing data interactively. The decision support system is based on a new proposed rough set analysis that plays a pivotal role and is employed dynamically. The approach realizes a competent sampling method in rough set analysis that distinguishes whether each subset can be classified in the focal set or not. The algorithm of the rough set model will be used to analyze obtained samples. In this paper we will first examine the design rules of Creative City development. Second, we will apply rough set theory to select the decision rules and measure the current status of Japanese cities.

A townscape, a stage of human life, can be read as a text. It consists of various signs such as properties, formal elements, and systems. We are able to find abundant meanings including image, atmosphere, orientation, identity, and cultural symbol. Therefore it is necessary to describe not only signs but also relations among signs, and to grasp the multi-modal semiosis of townscapes. It is possible to find many signs and relations. In this study, we regard the traditional townscapes in Japan as dynamical systems with semiosis in order to regenerate beautiful townscapes. Then we introduce the object system developed in the area of artificial intelligence, and describe the complex network of various signs in townscapes. It is possible to detect relation designs of townscapes and evaluate them using simulation systems based on the object system. © 2008 SICE.",Object system; Relation design; Semiosis; Similarities and differences; Townscape,Artificial intelligence; Dynamical systems; Information technology; Instruments; Schrodinger equation; Semiotics; Object system; Relation design; Semiosis; Similarities and differences; Townscape; Formal logic,,,,,,,"Empire of Signs Semiotic Essays on Japanese Culture, (1991); undefined, (2008); undefined, (2008); undefined, (2008); undefined, (2008); Computer Vision, (1982); Object Oriented Programming in Common Lisp, (1989); undefined, (2008); Summaries of Technical Papers of Annual Meeting, (2008); Proceedings of the 9th 10th Joint Seminar of Jsps Moe Core University Program on Urban Environment, (2005)","T.

In previous studies in this context statistical methods such as variance analysis and regression analysis are the most used techniques, and these suffer from the limitations of large sample sizes and rigorous statistical assumptions. However, the rough sets approach, as a nonparametric method of artificial intelligence, can handle this problem. In this study, twenty civil-engineering students and twenty noncivil-engineering students took part in an image preference survey assessing photographs of sidewalks. Then the rough sets approach was conducted by a four-step procedure to analyze the survey results. Finally, the output of the rough sets approach is used to express people's perception of good and bad features of sidewalk space. The results will hopefully help planners to make effective decisions about sidewalk features. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.",,artificial intelligence; pedestrian; perception; public space; urban design,,,,,,,"Nijkamp, Peter J., Time pioneers and travel behavior: An investigation into the viability of 'slow motion, Growth and Change, 30, 2, pp. 237-263, (1999); Düntsch, Ivo, Uncertainty measures of rough set prediction, Artificial Intelligence, 106, 1, pp. 109-137, (1998); van Egmond, Patrick W., A comparative analysis of the performance of urban public transport systems in Europe, International Social Science Journal, 55, 176, pp. 235-247, (2003); Ergin, Ayşen, A new methodology for evaluating coastal scenery: Fuzzy logic systems, Area, 36, 4, pp. 367-386, (2004); Rise of the Creative Class, (2002); Frank, Lawrence Douglas, Linking land use with household vehicle emissions in the central puget sound: Methodological framework and findings, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 5, 3, pp. 173-196, (2000); Health and Community Design the Impact of the Built Environment on Physical Activity, (2003); Fukahori, Kiyotaka, The role of design elements on the cost-effectiveness of streetscape improvement, Landscape and Urban Planning, 63, 2, pp. 75-91, (2003); Operational Tools in the Management of Financial Risks, (1998); undefined","M.
