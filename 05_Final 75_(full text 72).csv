Data collected from a field survey involving 24 public open spaces in Hong Kong, including perceptual responses from 1,882 participants and physical measurements, formed the basis of the analysis. The prediction model was constructed using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, as it outperformed the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and significantly exceeded the performance of traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) models in handling datasets with high contextual complexity. To circumvent the shortcomings of non-transparency and non-interpretable in machine-learning models, this study incorporated SHAP analysis to identify the most influential factors for open space soundscape and to investigate their interactions, which has not been revealed in earlier soundscape research. LAeq, perceived dominance of road traffic noise, greenery percentage and PET, were identified as the most influential factors. LAeq and perceived dominance of road traffic noise had significant negative effects, especially when LAeq exceeded 68 dBA. Greenery percentage showed a threshold effect, with dominant and positive contributions only when coverage exceeded 40 %. Notably, PET and its interaction with LAeq had a significant impact, with high temperatures (> 35 °C) intensifying the negative impacts of high sound pressure levels. These findings underscore the importance of “sound-visual-thermal” interactions and highlight that urban design should minimize the coexistence of high sound pressure levels, elevated temperatures, and heightened road traffic noise perceptions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Multisensory; Nonlinearity; SHAP analysis; Soundscape","China; Hong Kong; Acoustic field measurement; Acoustic noise measurement; Linear regression; Traffic surveys; Influential factors; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Multisensory; Nonlinearity; Public open spaces; Road traffic noise; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation analyze; Soundscapes; game theory; machine learning; noise; nonlinearity; open space; perception; public space; road traffic; urban design; Acoustic intensity measurement","","","","","","","Salih S.A., Ismail S., Criteria for public open space enhancement to achieve social interaction: a review paper, Iop Conf Ser-Mat Sci, 291, (2018); Lestan K.A., Erzen I., Golobic M., The role of open space in urban neighbourhoods for health-related lifestyle, Int.

However, since a dataset consisting of a huge amount of image and label pairs is required to utilize this technology, in most cases, a model trained with a dataset having similar characteristics is used for analysis, and as a result, the quality of segmentation is poor. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid model to leverage the strengths of each model in predicting specific classes. In particular, we first introduce a pre-processing operation to reduce the differences between the collected urban dataset and public dataset. Subsequently, we train several segmentation models with a pre-processed dataset then, based on the weight rule, the segmentation results are fused to create one segmentation map. To evaluate our proposal, we collected Google Street View images that do not have any labels and trained a model using the cityscapes dataset which contains foregrounds similar to the collected images. We quantitatively assessed its performance using the cityscapes dataset with ground truths and qualitatively evaluated the results of GSV data segmentation through user studies. Our approach outperformed existing methods and demonstrated the potential for accurate and efficient urban environment analysis using computer vision technology. © 2023 by the authors.","deep learning; hybrid model; image segmentation; streetscapes; urban environment analysis","","","","","","Semyung University, (2022); Semyung University; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (103434); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI","This paper was supported by the Semyung University Research Grant of 2022.","Rousselet J., Imbert C.E., Dekri A., Garcia J., Goussard F., Vincent B., Rossi J.P., Assessing species distribution using Google Street View: A pilot study with the pine processionary moth, PLoS ONE, 8, (2013); Rzotkiewicz A., Pearson A.L., Dougherty B.V., Shortridge A., Wilson N., Systematic review of the use of Google Street View in health research: Major themes, strengths, weaknesses and possibilities for future research, Health Place, 52, pp. 240-246, (2018); Yin L., Cheng Q., Wang Z., Shao Z., ‘Big data’ for pedestrian volume: Exploring the use of Google Street View images for pedestrian counts, Appl.

To date, only a few studies have used image analytics and deep learning methods to attempt to estimate these concepts based on a training set of user rated images. We aimed to 1) test whether the use of deep learning could be applied to predict perceptions of beauty, restorativeness, and naturalness in Google Street View (GSV) imagery (n = 3598 from across the USA); and 2) understand whether researcher-assigned theoretical constructs from the literature predict these concepts in intentionally-selected imagery (n = 6). A national sample of participants (n = 10,727) ranked the qualities of 11 randomly assigned images. We found it difficult to accurately predict ratings of beauty, restorativeness, and naturalness using GSV images. Consistently important image variables for the better-performing models included the total edge contrast index, the interspersion-juxtaposition index, and vertical vegetation. Important rater metrics include the binary Hispanic variable and the time the rater took to complete the survey. We also found similar correlations between the concepts of beauty, restorativeness, and naturalness by sex, urbanicity, and race/ethnicity whereby beauty and restorativeness had the largest correlation. We also found distinct constructs in the intentionally-selected images. Beauty and restorativeness could be predicted by the presence of water, and urban, maintained scenes. Imagery with greenery of various heights was associated with lower beauty and restorativeness and higher naturalness. Pure nature scenes were associated with both higher restorativeness and naturalness. For all three concepts, crowded views were significantly associated with lower values. Distinctly, expansive views were associated with beauty, and scenes with traditional structures were associated with lower naturalness. Future research may usefully explore geographic differences in ratings and the past experiences of participants, as drivers of image perceptions. Accurate prediction of image perceptions and understanding why certain people view or do not view particular images as beautiful, restorative, or natural may inform efforts to promote mental health through urban design. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Blue space; Google Street View; Green space; Mental health; Perceptions","United States; greenspace; image analysis; mental health; perception; spatiotemporal analysis","","","","","Michigan State University's Center for Data Analytics","Funding for half of the Amazon Mechanical Turk surveys came from Michigan State University's Center for Data Analytics.","Amigo E., Gonzalo J., Mizzaro S., Carrillo-de-Albornoz J., (2020); Bell S.L., Phoenix C., Lovell R., Wheeler B.W., Green space, health and wellbeing: Making space for individual agency, Health & Place, 30, pp. 287-292, (2014); Berman M.G., Hout M.C., Kardan O., Hunter M.R., Yourganov G., Henderson J.M., Jonides J., The perception of naturalness correlates with low-level visual features of environmental scenes, PLoS One1, 9, 12, (2014); Berman M.G., Jonides J., Kaplan S.A., The cognitive benefits of interacting with nature, Psychological Science, 19, 12, pp. 1207-1212, (2008); Berto R., The Role of Nature in Coping with Psycho-Physiological Stress: A Literature Review on Restorativeness, Behavioral Sciences, 4, 4, pp. 394-409, (2014); Birkhoff G.D., Aesthetic measures, (1933); Brown D.K., Barton J.L., Gladwell V.F., Viewing nature scenes positively affects recovery of autonomic function following acute-mental stress, Environmental Science & Technology, 47, pp. 5562-5569, (2013); Carrus G., Lafortezza R., Colangelo G., Dentamaro I., Scopelliti M., Sanesi G., Relations between naturalness and perceived restorativeness of different urban green spaces, PsyEcology, 4, 3, pp. 227-244, (2013); Chon J., Scott shafer C., Aesthetic Responses to Urban Greenway Trail Environments, Landscape Research, 34, 1, pp. 83-104, (2009); Conradson D., Landscape, care and the relational self: Therapeutic encounters in rural England, Health & Place, 11, 4, pp. 337-348, (2005); Cordts M., Omran M., Ramos S., Rehfeld T., Enzweiler M., Benenson R., Schiele B., pp. 3213-3223, (2016); Everitt B.S., Moments of statistics kappa and weighted kappa, British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 21, pp. 97-103, (1968); Finlay J., Franke T., McKay H., Sims-Gould J., Therapeutic landscapes and wellbeing in later life: Impacts of blue and green spaces for older adults, Health & Place, 34, pp. 97-106, (2015); Fisher J.C., Irvine K.N., Bicknell J.E., Hayes W.M., Fernandes D., Mistry J., Davies Z.G., Perceived biodiversity, sound, naturalness and safety enhance the restorative quality and wellbeing benefits of green and blue space in a neotropical city, Science of The Total Environment, 755, (2021); Galindo M.P., Hidalgo M.C., Aesthetic preferences and the attribution of meaning: Environmental categorization processes in the evaluation of urban scenes, International Journal of Psychology, 40, 1, pp. 19-27, (2005); Gatersleben B., Andrews M., When walking in nature is not restorative—The role of prospect and refuge, Health & Place, 20, pp. 91-101, (2013); Gladwell V.F., Brown D.K., Barton J.L., Tarvainen M.P., Kuoppa P., Pretty J., Sandercock G.R., The effects of views of nature on autonomic control, European Journal of Applied Physiology, 112, pp. 3379-3386, (2012); Hartig T., Korpela K., Evans G.W., Garling T., A measure of restorative quality in environments, Scandinavian Housing and Planning Research, 14, 4, pp. 175-194, (1997); Hesselbarth M.H.K., Sciaini M., With K.A., Wiegand K., Nowosad J., Landscapemetrics: An open-source R tool to calculate landscape metrics, Ecography, 42, 10, pp. 1648-1657, (2019); Hoyle H., Hitchmough J., Jorgensen A., All about the ‘wow factor’?

Given the significant impact of land shape on architectural and urban planning outcomes, its analysis is essential. However, studies on land shape have been limited due to the lack of definitive survey criteria. To address these challenges, this study utilized a map application programming interface (API) to gather raw data on apartment complex layouts in South Korea and processed these images using a Python-based image library. An initial analysis involved categorizing the data through K-means clustering. Each cluster’s average image was classified into four distinct groups for comparison with the existing literature. Shape indices were employed to analyze land configurations and assess consistency across classes. These classes were annotated on a parcel level using the Roboflow API, and YOLOv8s-cls was developed to classify the parcels effectively. The evaluation of this model involved calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score from a confusion matrix. The results show a strong correlation between the identified and established classes, with the YOLO model achieving an accuracy of 86% and demonstrating robust prediction capabilities across classes. This confirms the effective typification of land shapes in the studied apartment complexes. This study introduces a methodology for analyzing parcel shapes through machine learning and deep learning. It asserts that this approach transcends the confines of South Korean apartment complexes, extending its applicability to architectural and urban design planning on a global scale. Analyzing land shapes earmarked for construction enables the formulation of diverse design strategies for building placement and external space arrangement. This highlights the potential for innovative design approaches in architectural and urban planning worldwide. © 2024 by the authors.","apartment complex; deep learning; image classification; machine learning; YOLOv8","Apartment houses; Application programming interfaces (API); Architectural design; Deep learning; K-means clustering; Land use; Learning systems; Python; Urban planning; Apartment complexes; Applications programming interfaces; Deep learning; Image library; Images classification; Land parcels; Learning techniques; Machine-learning; South Korea; YOLOv8; Image classification","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; NRF; MSIT; Hyupsung University, UHS","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.RS-2022-0016605712482147660003) and the Hyupsung University Research Grant of 2024).","Lee I., Lim S., Kim C., Analysis of the effect of parcel shape on the development density, J.

We illustrate the merits of our approach by explaining computer vision models used to analyse street imagery, which are now widely used in GeoAI and urban analytics. Such explanations are important in urban analytics as researchers and practioners are increasingly reliant on it for decision making. Finally, we perform a user study that demonstrate our approach can be used by non-expert users, who might not be machine learning experts, to be more confident and to better understand the behaviour of image-based classifiers/regressors for street view analysis. Furthermore, the method can potentially be used as an engagement tool to visualise how public spaces can plausibly look like. The limited realism of the counterfactuals is a concern which we hope to improve in the future. © 2023 The Author(s).

The use of these typologies and finding similarities and dissimilarities between cities enables better targeted interventions for improved health, transport, and environmental outcomes in urban areas. A better understanding of local contexts can also assist in applying lessons learned from other cities. Constructing urban typologies at a global scale through traditional methods, such as functional or network analysis, requires the collection of data across multiple political districts, which can be inconsistent and then require a level of subjective classification. To overcome these limitations, we use neural networks to analyse millions of images of urban form (consisting of street view, satellite imagery, and street maps) to find shared characteristics between the largest 1692 cities in the world. The comparison city of Paris is used as an exemplar and we perform a case study using two Australian cities, Melbourne and Sydney, to determine if a “Paris-end” of town exists or can be found in these cities using these three big data imagery sets. The results show specific advantages and disadvantages of each type of imagery in constructing urban typologies. Neural networks trained with map imagery will be highly influenced by the structural mix of roads, public transport, and green and blue space. Satellite imagery captures a combination of both urban form and decorative and natural details. The use of street view imagery emphasises the features of a human-scaled visual geography of streetscapes. However, for both satellite and street view imagery to be highly effective, a reduction in scale and more aggressive pre-processing might be required in order to reduce detail and create greater abstraction in the imagery. © 2020 by the authors.","health; machine learning; transport; urban design; urban typology","","","","","","National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (APP1136250); University of Melbourne, UNIMELB","This project was made possible thanks to computer hardware purchased by the Transportation, Health, and Urban Design (THUD) Research Lab at the University of Melbourne.

Plant landscaping is the core component of urban landscape design. By analyzing and discussing the application of plant landscaping in urban landscape design, the quality level of urban landscape design can be further improved, thereby promoting the sustainable development of urban construction. Machine learning makes it possible to realize the intelligent processing of data and make full use of the knowledge and value contained in the data. This paper explores the way of intelligent analysis and application based on machine learning in the field of landscape architecture. First, the k-means machine learning clustering method is used to determine the types of plant landscaping required by modern urban landscape design. Experiments show that our model can be well applied to design applications of modern urban landscapes.  © 2022 Dan Liu.","","K-means clustering; Land use; Plants (botany); Sustainable development; Continuous improvements; Core components; Design work; Landscape design; Living standards; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; On-machines; Quality levels; Urban landscape; Machine learning","","","","","","","He Q., Li N., Luo W.J., Overview of machine learning algorithms under big data, Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, 27, 4, pp. 327-336, (2014); Zhao J., Cao Y., Overview of artificial intelligence methods in landscape architecture research, Chinese Landscape Architecture, 36, 5, (2020); Zhang Y.H., Zhao G.X., Classification methods of land use/cover based on remote sensing technologies, Journal of China Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, 23, 3, (2002); Wu J., Liu M.S., Li W.T., Research advances in remote sensing information extracting technology for natural reserves, World Forestry Research, 26, 1, (2013); Liu R.H., Liang S.C., Zhao H.Y., Progress of Chinese coastal wetland based on remote sensing, Remote Sensing Technology and Application, 32, 6, pp. 998-1011, (2017); Zhang C., Lu Y.H., Yun W.J., Analysis on research progress of remote sensing monitoring of land consolidation, Journal of Agricultural Machinery, 50, 1, (2019); Thiffault E., Webster K., Lafleur B., Wilson S., Mansuy N., Biophysical indicators based on spatial hierarchy for informing land reclamation: The case of the Lower Athabasca River (Alberta, Canada), Ecological Indicators, 72, pp. 173-184, (2017); Wang K., Gou C., Duan Y., Lin Y., Zheng X., Wang F.-Y., Generative adversarial networks: Introduction and outlook, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 4, 4, pp. 588-598, (2017); Che T., Luo Y.J., Li C., Spatiotemporal change and its driving factors of built-up land sprawl in Yangzhou City, Chinese Journal of Ecology, 38, 6, pp. 1872-1880, (2019); Sun H.C., Zhang Z.X., Change of landscape pattern vulnerability in the songhua river basin in jilin province and its driving forces, Arid Zone Research, 36, 4, (2019); Che T., Luo Y.J., Quantifying effects of socioeconomic development on urban landscape fragmentation, Journal of Nanjing Forestry University (Natural Sciences Edition), 44, 1, (2020); Wu J.H., Fang S.F., Liu B.J., Landscape pattern evolution of wetland and it s drving mechanism in Wuyuer-Shuangyang River Basin, Chinese Journal of Ecology, 40, 13, (2020); Chen L.Y., Xu X., A study on tourists perceptual characteristics of suzhou gardens: Based on the multidimensional analysis of the travel notes, Tourism and Hospitality Prospects, 1, 5, (2017); Kumar V., Nayak J.K., Destination personality: Scale development and validation, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research, 42, 1, pp. 3-25, (2014); Chen C.F., Phou S., A closer look at destination: Image, personality, relationship and loyalty, Tourism Management, 36, 3, pp. 269-278, (2013); Hultman M., Skarmeas D., Oghazi P., Beheshti H.M., Achieving tourist loyalty through destination personality, satisfaction, and identification, Journal of Business Research, 68, 11, pp. 2227-2231, (2015)","D.

Reliable and up-to-date information on urban vegetation is therefore needed as a basis for sustainable urban design and regular tasks such as vegetation maintenance. Mobile laser scanning (MLS), i. e., the use of vehicle-mounted laser scanners, offers strong potential for capturing 3D point clouds of road environments on a large scale at a low cost. In this paper, the potential and challenges of using MLS for vegetation mapping are discussed. To lay a foundation for MLS-based inventories of roadside vegetation, a concept for the automatic detection and analysis of vegetation in MLS point clouds using deep learning is presented. The proposed workflow covers vegetation detection and classification, delineation of individual trees, and estimation of tree attributes. In a case study, an initial implementation of the work-flow is tested using MLS datasets from two German cities and the results are evaluated through visual inspection. It is demonstrated that the proposed deep-learning approach is able to detect and classify vegetation in MLS point clouds of complex urban road scenes. When delineating individual trees, accurate results are obtained for solitary trees and trees with little canopy overlap, while the delineation of trees with strongly overlapping canopies needs further improvement in some cases. The results indi-cate that geometric tree attributes such as tree height and trunk diameter can be accurately estimated from MLS point clouds if the accuracy of the preceding processing steps is sufficiently high. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH ·.","deep learning; LiDAR; mobile mapping; tree inventory; Vegetation mapping","","","","","","AllTerra Deutsch-land GmbH; BMDV, (19F2210, TWIN4ROAD); Department for Geoinformation, Surveying and Cadastre of the City of Essen; TreeDigitalTwins, (033L305); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01IS22062)","Funding text 1: We thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback as well as AllTerra Deutschland GmbH and the Department for Geoinformation, Surveying and Cadastre of the City of Essen for providing mobile mapping data.

This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity. These findings hold implications for urban planning and water distribution design to mitigate potential cascading failures.  © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Complexity; Interdependency; Transportation networks; Urban morphology; Water distribution networks","Decision trees; Morphology; Topology; Water supply systems; Connectivity profile; Failure propagation; Network connectivity; Random forest modeling; Topological connectivity; Transportation interface; Transportation system; Water distributions; prediction; transportation system; urban design; urban morphology; urban planning; water supply; Urban transportation","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1638301)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1638301.

These elements also provide information during navigation—particularly for people with cognitive difficulties or those unfamiliar with the geographical area. Nevertheless, some urban components are less eye-catching than intended because they are created and positioned irrespective of their surroundings. While quantitative measures such as eye tracking have been introduced, they help the initial or final stage of the urban design process and they involve expensive experiments. We introduce machine-learning-predicted visual saliency as iterative feedback for pedestrian attention during urban element design. Our user study focused on wayfinding signs as part of urban design and revealed that providing saliency prediction promoted a more efficient and helpful design experience without compromising usability. The saliency-guided design practice also contributed to producing more eye-catching and aesthetically pleasing urban elements. The study demonstrated that visual saliency can lead to an improved urban design experience and outcome, resulting in more accessible cities for citizens, visitors, and people with cognitive impairments. © 2023 by the authors.","design feedback; urban planning; visual saliency; wayfinding design","aid; machine learning; pedestrian; urban design; urban planning; visual analysis","","","","","GIST-MIT; Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, GIST; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20204010600340); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2021R1A4A1030075); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning, KETEP","This research was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the MSIT (2021R1A4A1030075), in part by the the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (No. 20204010600340), and in part by the GIST-MIT Research Collaboration grant funded by the GIST in 2023.","Caduff D., Timpf S., On the assessment of landmark salience for human navigation, Cogn.

With the help of recently emerged street view images and machine learning algorithms, an evaluation model has been trained to assess the perceived visual quality with accuracy similar to that of experienced urban designers, to provide full coverage and detailed results for a citywide area. The town centre of Shanghai was selected for the site. Around 140,000 screenshots from Baidu Street View were processed and a machine learning algorithm, SegNet, was applied to intelligently extract the pixels representing key elements affecting the visual quality of streets, including the building frontage, greenery, sky view, pedestrian space, motorisation, and diversity. A Java-based program was then produced to automatically collect the preferences of experienced urban designers on representative sample images. Another machine learning algorithm, i.e. an artificial neural network, was used to train an evaluation model to achieve a citywide, high-resolution evaluation of the visual quality of the streets. Further validation through different approaches shows this evaluation model obtains a satisfactory accuracy. The results from the artificial neural network also help to explore the high or low effects of various key elements on visual quality. In short, this study contributes to the development of human-centred planning and design by providing continuous measurements of an ‘unmeasurable’ quality across large-scale areas. Meanwhile, insights on the perceptual-based visual quality and detailed mapping of various key elements in streets can assist in more efficient street renewal by providing accurate design guidance. © The Author(s) 2019.","machine learning; street; Street view images; urban design; visual quality","China; Shanghai; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; guideline; image analysis; image resolution; machine learning; mapping method; pixel; quantitative analysis; urban design","","","","","","","Badrinarayanan V., Kendall A., Cipolla R., Segnet: A deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 2, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); (2015); Banerjee T., Southworth M., City Sense and City Design.

A few municipalities have officially legalized both the selling and purchasing of sex, while others unofficially criminalize purchasing sex but have decriminalized its sale. In addition, there are many other locales with no official guidance on the subject but have unofficially decriminalized sex work by designating specific areas in an urban landscape safe from law enforcement for commercial sex, by quietly ceasing to arrest sex sellers, or by declining to prosecute anyone selling or attempting to sell sex. Despite these efforts, it remains crucial to understand where in an urban area commercial sex exchanges occur—legalization and decriminalization may result in fewer arrests but is likely to increase the overall size of the sex market. This growth could result in an increase in sex trafficking victimization, which makes up the majority of commercial sex sellers in any domestic market. Given the distribution of prostitution activities in most communities, it is possible to use high-fidelity predictive models to identify intervention opportunities related to sex trafficking victimization. In this research, we construct several machine learning models and inform them with a range of known criminogenic factors to predict locations hosting high levels of prostitution. We demonstrate these methods in the city of Chicago, Illinois. The results of this exploratory analysis identified a range of explanatory factors driving prostitution activity throughout Chicago, and the best-performing model correctly predicted prostitution frequency with 94% accuracy. We conclude by exploring specific areas of under- and over-prediction throughout Chicago and discuss the implications of these results for allocating social support efforts. © 2022 by the authors.","crime forecasting; logistic regression; machine learning; neural network; prostitution prediction; spatial analysis","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2039917)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2039917.","Perry W.L., Predictive Policing: The Role of Crime Forecasting in Law Enforcement Operations, (2013); Meijer A., Wessels M., Predictive policing: Review of benefits and drawbacks, Int.

Focusing on Fangzhou Ancient City, we address historical spatial degradation caused by excessive industrialization and disordered urban expansion. A methodological framework is proposed, combining low-altitude UAV-derived high-density point cloud data with RandLA-Net for semi-automatic semantic segmentation of buildings, vegetation, and roads by integrating multispectral and geometric attributes. Key findings reveal: (1) Modern buildings’ abnormal elevation in steep slopes disrupts the plateau–city visual corridor; (2) Statistical analysis shows significant morphological disparities between historical and modern streets; (3) Modern structures exceed traditional height limits, while divergent roof slopes aggravate aesthetic fragmentation. This multi-level spatial analysis offers a paradigm for quantifying historical urban spaces and validates deep learning’s feasibility in heritage spatial analytics, providing insights for balancing conservation and development in ecologically fragile areas. © 2025 by the authors.","cultural heritage preservation; historic urban landscape; point cloud classification; RandLA-Net; three-dimensional spatial analysis","China; aerial survey; building; classification; feasibility study; gully; heritage conservation; industrialization; landscape structure; model validation; segmentation; spatial analysis; spectral analysis; three-dimensional modeling; unmanned vehicle; urban history","","","","","","","Farahani L.M., Setayesh M., Shokrollahi L., Contextualizing Palimpsest of Collective Memory in an Urban Heritage Site: Case Study of Chahar Bagh, Shiraz—Iran, Archnet-IJAR, 9, pp. 218-231, (2015); Khalaf R.W., A Proposal to Apply the Historic Urban Landscape Approach to Reconstruction in the World Heritage Context, Hist.

Taking the city of Guangzhou as a case study, deep learning was combined with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform effective image recognition, vector cutting, and automatic area statistics based on multilevel road networks. Road network division, block area processing, characteristic parameter calculation, and LCZ classification were integrated to automatically generate block-scale-oriented LCZ maps, which was achieved via threshold contrast using the recommended parameter intervals of the calculated characteristic parameters. Basic land surface temperature (LST) data for summer to winter in Guangzhou were then applied, and correlation analysis was conducted between the block-scale LST vector and LCZ characteristic parameters. The results demonstrate the applicability and potential of the CNN algorithm for urban climate analysis. The developed CNN-based LCZ mapping approach prioritizes “block” scale analysis and typical characteristic parameters in each block are obtained with high calculation accuracy. This study contributes to guiding parameterized climate-sensitive urban planning. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","City blocks; Convolutional neural networks; Local climate zone; Satellite image; Urban climate","China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Convolution; Deep learning; Image recognition; Mapping; Roads and streets; Urban planning; Characteristics parameters; City block; Convolutional neural network; Guangzhou; Local climate; Local climate zone; Network-based; Satellite images; Urban climates; Zone mapping; artificial neural network; satellite imagery; urban climate; urban design; urban development; urban planning; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52208099); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2023A1515012161); Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project, (202201010274)","Authors really appreciate all the participants devoted to programming the CNN-based algorithm.

However, a majority of recommendations summarized by scholars for promoting TODs through urban design have failed to promote the progress of the urban design. The main reason for this issue is the long-standing tradition of design decision-making based on designers’ experience and the lack of quantitative assessment feedback on design schemes. With the development of big data and artificial intelligence, optimisation-based generative design has been explored to overcome the limitations of experience-based urban design approaches. However, the techniques and workflows are still not mature enough for designers to adopt. In response to these challenges, this study proposes a framework that integrates the generative design method and data-driven decision-making approach for urban design solutions that better implement the basic principles of TODs. Based on the urban design intelligence for TODs, this framework uses parametric tools and models to evaluate the generative urban design proposals, providing timely feedback to support the design decisions. The framework is applied to a case study to examine the feasibility. It is demonstrated that this approach succeeds in selecting optimal TOD design solutions. The role of designers’ decision-making in generative urban design, as well as the importance of quantitative and qualitative assessment in experience-based decision-making, are highlighted. © 2022 by the authors.","activity-based model; amenity accessibility; evidence-based design decision-making; generative urban design; transit-oriented development; walkability","","","","","","Beijing High-level Overseas Talents Support Funding, R&D Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission, (KM202210009008); Australian Research Council, ARC, (LP190100089); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52208039); North China University of Technology, NCUT; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFF0304900)","This project is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [52208039], the National key R&D program “Science and Technology Winter Olympics” key project “Evacuation system and support technology for assisting physically challenged communities” [2020YFF0304900], the Beijing High-level Overseas Talents Support Funding, R&D Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (KM202210009008), the NCUT Young Scholar Development Project, and the Australian Research Council Linkage Project [LP190100089].","Thomas R., Bertolini L., Transit-Oriented Development: Learning from International Case Studies, (2020); Ibraeva A., de Correia G.H.A., Silva C., Antunes A.P., Transit-oriented development: A review of research achievements and challenges, Transp.

However, getting high resolution multi-faceted data about a city has been a challenge. Further, even when the data were available the integration into a model is even more of a challenge due to the parametric needs, and the data volumes. Further, even if this is achieved, the cities themselves continually evolve rendering the data obsolete, thus necessitating a fast and repeatable data capture mechanism. We have shown that by using AI/graphics community advances we can create a seamless opportunity for high resolution models. Instead of assuming every physical and behavioral detail is sensed, a generative and procedural approach seeks to computationally infer a fully detailed 3D fit-for-purpose model of an urban space. We present a perspective building on recent success results of this generative approach applied to urban design and planning at different scales, for different components of the urban landscape, and related applications. The opportunities now possible with such a generative model for urban modeling open a wide range of opportunities as this becomes mainstream. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Generative AI; Urban computational science; Urban modeling","Climate models; Urban planning; Climate assessment; Climate simulation; Computational science; Data volume; Generative AI; High resolution; Numerical prediction models; Urban computational science; Urban modeling; Weather simulation; Artificial intelligence","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1835739, 1816514, 2106717, 2032770); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work has been funded by several US NSF grants including #1835739, #1816514, #2106717, and #2032770.

Such analysis becomes challenging for urban networks as their size and complexity are significantly higher compared to other networks. The state-of-the-art machine learning techniques allow us to detect hidden patterns and, thus, infer the features associated with them. However, very little is known about the impact on the performance of such predictive models by the use of different input representations. In this paper, we design and evaluate six different graph input representations (i.e. representations of the network paths), by considering the network’s topological and temporal characteristics, for being used as inputs for machine learning models to learn the behavior of urban network paths. The representations are validated and then tested with a real-world taxi journeys dataset predicting the tips of using a road network of New York. Our results demonstrate that the input representations that use temporal information help the model to achieve the highest accuracy (root mean-squared error of 1.42$). © The Author(s) 2019.","graph learning; path representation; Urban networks","New York [United States]; United States; complexity; machine learning; network analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban design; urban development; urban planning","","","","","University College London, UCL; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/L006340/1, EP/P016278/1); Alan Turing Institute, (EP/N510129/1)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported through the EPSRC Grants EP/L006340/1 and EP/P016278/1 at UCL and by The Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC Grant EP/N510129/1.","Aggarwal C.C., Wang H., Managing and Mining Graph Data, (2010); Ahuja R.K., Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications, (2017); Arun K., Rejimoan R., (2016); Bengio Y., Courville A., Pascal V., Representation learning: A review and new perspectives, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35, pp. 1798-1828, (2013); Bondy J.A., Graph Theory with Applications, (1976); Compagnon P., Olliver K., (2016); Cox D.R., The regression analysis of binary sequences, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

With densely built modernist architecture and relatively free building regulations, it is challenging to trace the actual development of the whole city. Compared to European cities, their overall urban landscapes are much denser, higher, and functionally mixed. In order to achieve a quicker and more accurate identification of urban forms in mega-cities, this study proposed a two-level machine-learning approach. At the building level, we extracted features from topographic maps and building licenses to automatically classify building types. Four state-of-the-art multi-class classification models were compared. At the block level, we used building types as input data and compared two methods for block clustering. In total 61,426 buildings from Taipei were classified and grouped into 10 block types. Different from Western cities, many of the block types in Taipei were mixtures of different types of buildings. This approach is efficient in exploring new urban form types, especially for emerging mega-cities where block types are previously unknown.

This study aims to use advanced deep learning technology and generative adversarial networks to construct an efficient urban and rural landscape feature recognition model to achieve accurate analysis and classification of urban and rural landscape elements. This paper first introduces the basic principles of deep learning and generative adversarial networks and their application status in the field of urban and rural landscape feature processing and then elaborates on how to combine these two technologies to design a new urban and rural landscape feature recognition framework. The model is trained by a large number of multi-source data sets such as high-resolution satellite images and aerial photos, and successfully extracts key elements such as architectural style, green coverage, road layout, etc., and can accurately transform this information into intuitive visual expression, providing a scientific basis for subsequent urban planning. Experiments show that after training with 50,000 images, the proposed model has achieved satisfactory results: the accuracy rate of urban and rural landscape feature recognition reaches 93.2%, which is better than the current mainstream algorithms. This achievement not only helps to deepen our understanding of the spatial pattern of urban and rural areas but may also be widely used in cultural heritage protection, ecological environment monitoring, tourism development and other fields, which have important theoretical value and social significance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Applied research; Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Model construction; Urban and rural landscape feature recognition","Adversarial networks; Applied research; Deep learning; Features recognition; Landscape feature; Model construction; Rural landscapes; Urban and rural; Urban and rural landscape feature recognition; Urban landscape; algorithm; cultural heritage; landscape ecology; rural area; rural landscape; satellite imagery; tourism development; Generative adversarial networks","","","","","","","Allawi A.H., Al-Jazaer H.M.J., A new approach towards the sustainability of urban-rural integration: The development strategy for central villages in the Abbasiya district of Iraq using GIS techniques,, Regional Sustainability, 4, 1, pp. 28-43, (2023); Anriquez G., Calabrese J., Foster W., Keim K., Osses P., Refining the scale of the rural-urban landscape: A policy-relevant application to Chile, Applied Geography, 168, (2024); Bobadilla J., Gutierrez A., Wasserstein GAN-based architecture to generate collaborative filtering synthetic datasets, Applied Intelligence, 54, 3, pp. 2472-2490, (2024); Chandra R., Goyal S., Gupta R., Evaluation of deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction, Ieee Access, 9, pp. 83105-83123, (2021); Chew A.W.Z., Ji A., Zhang L., Large-scale 3D point-cloud semantic segmentation of urban and rural scenes using data volume decomposition coupled with pipeline parallelism, Automation in Construction, 133, (2022); Dietz K., Seufert M., Hossfeld T., Want more WANs?

However, traditional assessment methods, such as the green view index, primarily quantify green coverage while neglecting vegetation diversity, color richness, and seasonal dynamics, which are critical for urban livability. Objectives: This study develops a multi-temporal and multi-perspective analysis framework for urban green space visualization, introducing the Seasonal Species-Specific Plant View Index (S3PVI) to quantify plant coverage at the species level, capturing seasonal changes and visual diversity. Methods: The framework integrates computer vision, deep learning, and 3D reconstruction technologies, including structure from motion and 3D Gaussian splatting. To validate the S3PVI, case studies were conducted in Suita City, Japan, analyzing real-world seasonal vegetation patterns and testing the framework in a virtual park environment to assess its applicability in urban design. Results: The S3PVI effectively captured species-specific seasonal patterns, with cherry blossoms peaking at 45.61% visibility in spring and maples at 56.78% in autumn. Comparative analysis revealed distinctive vegetation strategies between streets, with Sanshikisaido showing higher seasonal amplitude but lower consistency than Nakayoshido. Virtual simulations confirmed that multi-species schemes optimally balanced seasonal impact with year-round visual stability. Conclusions: The S3PVI framework advances urban vegetation assessment by providing species-specific and seasonally dynamic visual data, supporting evidence-based urban planning for ecological sustainability and livability. Potential applications include brownfield redevelopment, virtual park planning, and urban design simulations. © The Author(s) 2025.","3D reconstruction; Multi-temporal analysis; Semantic segmentation; Street view imagery; Urban green space; Vegetation visualization","Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Osaka [Kinki]; Suita; environmental quality; greenspace; reconstruction; satellite imagery; segmentation; semantic standardization; sustainability; temporal analysis; urban design; urban ecosystem; urban planning; vegetation dynamics; visualization","","","","","University of Osaka","Open Access funding provided by The University of Osaka.

Understanding these decisions is essential for effective urban planning. While discrete choice models have been used to predict residential locations, their limitations in handling complex datasets have hindered their accuracy. Machine learning has shown potential to outperform discrete choice methods in transportation-related decisions like travel mode. However, the traditional application of these methods to residential location choice faces challenges due to the large number of choice alternatives and the limitations of sample size and data availability. This often leads to biased predictions, favoring popular choices over less common ones. This study introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations, making machine learning more effective for residential location choice. By applying this method and different machine learning models, the study provides a detailed comparison of their performance in predicting residential choices. A comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms reveals that XGBoost and gradient boosting models significantly outperform traditional methods, achieving a 42 % accuracy rate in predicting residential location choices on the 33 % validation data of household travel survey data from MWCOG. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to optimize land use, transportation, and urban development strategies. © 2025 The Author(s)","Extra tree; Gradient boosting; Machine learning; Random forest; Residential location choice; Stacking technique; Voting technique; XGBoost","Adversarial machine learning; Random forests; Urban transportation; Extra-trees; Gradient boosting; Location choice; Machine-learning; Random forests; Residential location choice; Residential locations; Stacking technique; Stackings; Voting techniques; Xgboost; Contrastive Learning","","","","","","","Abulibdeh A., Analysis of mode choice affects from the introduction of Doha Metro using machine learning and statistical analysis, Transp.

While predictive models like deep learning and Markov models offer insights into individual mobility, they often struggle with out-of-routine behaviors. Our study introduces an approach that dynamically integrates individual and collective mobility behaviors, leveraging collective intelligence to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluating the model on millions of privacy-preserving trajectories across five US cities, we demonstrate its superior performance in predicting out-of-routine mobility, surpassing even advanced deep learning methods. The spatial analysis highlights the model’s effectiveness near urban areas with a high density of points of interest, where collective behaviors strongly influence mobility. During disruptive events like the COVID-19 pandemic, our model retains predictive capabilities, unlike individual-based models. By bridging the gap between individual and collective behaviors, our approach offers transparent and accurate predictions, which are crucial for addressing contemporary mobility challenges.

However, existing building material databases are typically limited to individual projects or specific geographic areas, offering only approximate assessments. Acquiring large-scale and precise material data is hindered by inadequate records and financial constraints. Here, we introduce a novel automated framework that harnesses recent advances in sensing technology and deep learning to identify roof and facade materials using remote sensing data and Google Street View imagery. The model was initially trained and validated on Odense's comprehensive dataset and then extended to characterize building materials across Danish urban landscapes, including Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Our approach demonstrates the model's scalability and adaptability to different geographic contexts and architectural styles, providing high-resolution insights into material distribution across diverse building types and cities. These findings are pivotal for informing sustainable urban planning, revising building codes to lower carbon emissions, and optimizing retrofitting efforts to meet contemporary standards for energy efficiency and emission reductions. © 2025","Building material intensity; Built environment; Deep learning; Remote sensing; Streetview image","","","","","","Independent Research Fund Denmark; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Peking University; European Commission, EC, (101056810); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202107940001, 202006730004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71991484, 71991480)","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71991484, 71991480), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Peking University, the Independent Research Fund Denmark (iBuildGreen), the European Union under grant agreement No. 101056810 (CircEUlar), and the China Scholarship Council (202006730004 and 202107940001).

Traditional methods for investigating the urban thermal environment and corresponding human thermal comfort level are often resource intensive, inefficient, and limited in scope. To address these challenges, we (1) introduce a new concept named thermal affordance, which formalises the integrated inherent capacity of a streetscape to influence human thermal comfort based on its visual and physical features; and (2) an efficient method to evaluate it (visual assessment of thermal affordance — VATA), which combines street view imagery (SVI), online and in-field surveys, and statistical learning algorithms. VATA extracts five categories of image features from SVI data and establishes 19 visual-perceptual indicators for streetscape visual assessment. Using a multi-task neural network and elastic net regression, we model their chained relationship to predict and comprehend thermal affordance for Singapore. VATA predictions are validated with field-investigated OTC data, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and transferable method to assess the thermal comfort potential of urban streetscape. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by generating a geospatially explicit mapping of thermal affordance, outlining a model update workflow for long-term urban-scale analysis, and implementing a two-stage prediction and inference approach (IF-VPI-VATA) to guide future streetscape improvements. This framework can inform streetscape design to support sustainable, liveable, and resilient urban environments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Heat mitigation; Human-centric geoAI; Perception; Sustainability; Urban design; Urban planning","Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Thermal comfort; Affordances; Heat mitigation; Human thermal comfort; Human-centric; Human-centric geoai; Sustainable urban development; Thermal; Urban design; Urban Heat Island Effects; Visual assessments; artificial intelligence; mapping method; perception; satellite imagery; sustainability; temperature effect; urban design; urban planning; visual analysis; Sustainable city","","","","","Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE; European Research Council, ERC, (2024/DOA/002, GRSUR0600042); European Research Council, ERC; National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-295-000-171-133, GRSUR0600042); National University of Singapore, NUS","Funding text 1: We gratefully acknowledge the participants of the experiment.

However, the definition and measurement of urban vibrancy have not been consistently and clearly followed. With the development of technologies such as big data and machine learning, urban planners have adopted new methods that enable better quantitative evaluation of urban performance. This research attempts to quantify the impact on the urban vibrancy of the urban interventions introduced by the LivingLine project in a residential neighborhood renovation made in Siping Street, Shanghai. We use Wi-Fi probes to process collected mobile phone data and segment people into different categories according to commuting patterns analysis. We use a pre-trained random forest model to determine the specific locations of each person. Subsequently, we analyze the behavior patterns of people from stay points detection and trajectory analysis. Through statistical models, we apply multi-linear regression and find that urban intervention (well-curated and defined lab events deployed in the street) and people’s behavior are positively correlated, which helps us to prove the impact of urban intervention on street dynamics. The research proposes a novel, evidence-based, low-cost methodology for studying granular behavior patterns on a street level without compromising users’ data privacy. © The Author(s) 2023.","behavioral analysis; machine learning; multi-linear regression; Street activities; urban vibrancy; Wi-Fi data","China; Shanghai; algorithm; commuting; machine learning; neighborhood; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area","","","","","","","Barreca A., Curto R., Rolando D., Urban vibrancy: an emerging factor that spatially influences the real estate market, Sustainability, 12, 1, (2020); Bellomo N., Clarke D., Gibelli L., Et al., Human behaviours in evacuation crowd dynamics: from modelling to “big data” toward crisis management, Physics of Life Reviews, 18, pp. 1-21, (2016); Cai X., Cao Y., Dong P., Velocity-based trajectory stop point recognition algorithm, Computer Systems and Applications, 29, 4, pp. 214-219, (2020); Calabrese F., Reades J., Ratti C., Eigenplaces: segmenting space through digital signatures, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 9, 1, pp. 78-84, (2010); Chilipirea C., Crowd Data Analytics as Seen from Wifi: A Critical Review, (2019); Gansner E.R., Hu Y., North S., Et al., Multilevel agglomerative edge bundling for visualizing large graphs, 2011 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium, pp. 187-194, (2011); Griffiths R., Cultural strategies and new modes of urban intervention, Cities, 12, 4, pp. 253-265, (1995); Hu X., Shen P., Shi Y., Et al., Using Wi-Fi probe and location data to analyze the human distribution characteristics of green spaces: a case study of the Yanfu Greenland Park, China, Urban Forestry & Urban Greening, 54, (2020); Huang B., Zhou Y., Li Z., Et al., Evaluating and characterizing urban vibrancy using spatial big data: Shanghai as a case study, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 47, 9, pp. 1543-1559, (2019); Huang B., Zhou Y., Li Z., Et al., Evaluating and characterizing urban vibrancy using spatial big data: Shanghai as a case study, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 47, 9, pp. 1543-1559, (2020); Jacobs J., Death and Life of Great American Cities, (1961); Jacobs A., Great Streets, (1993); Jiang C., Xiao Y., Cao H., Co-creating for locality and sustainability: design-driven community regeneration strategy in shanghai’s old residential context, Sustainability, 12, 7, (2020); Kim Y., Seoul’s Wi-Fi hotspots: Wi-Fi access points as an indicator of urban vitality, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 72, pp. 13-24, (2018); Kontokosta C., Johnson N., Urban phenology: toward a real-time census of the city using Wi-Fi data, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 64, pp. 144-153, (2017); Lang W., Hui E.C., Chen T., Et al., Understanding livable dense urban form for social activities in transit-oriented development through human-scale measurements, Habitat International, 104, (2020); Li Q., Zheng Y., Xie X., Et al., Mining user similarity based on location history, (2008); Liu Y., Cheng D., Pei T., Et al., Inferring gender and age of customers in shopping malls via indoor positioning data, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 47, 9, pp. 1672-1689, (2019); Long Y., Huang C., Does block size matter?

Tmrt is heavily influenced by urban morphology, including building layout, street design, and green spaces which alter airflow, shading, and heat retention. Evaluating geometry alternatives during the early design stages in urban neighborhoods is challenging due to lengthy simulations and the need for extensive expertise in physical models. Recent studies have employed data-driven methods for quick design comparisons and new urban layout evaluations, successfully predicting Thermal indicators of Urban heat Island phenomenon but often limited by the diversity of urban configurations inputs used in training datasets. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel framework that uses machine learning models to predict Tmrt as the primary indicator. A comprehensive training dataset of 200 cases was generated in Rhino7 using Grasshopper, Ladybug, and Dragonfly plugins. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of input uncertainties on model predictions, and the model's performance was validated against unseen configurations. Among six machine learning algorithms tested, the CatBoost Regressor achieved the highest accuracy, predicting Tmrt with an R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 4.30 °C, and MAE = 2.34 °C. Validation using 20 additional cases showed an accuracy of R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 3.34 °C, and MAE = 2.27 °C in predicting Tmrt heat maps for new urban configurations. This framework successfully enables real-time Tmrt heat map analysis in simplified cubic neighborhoods within a 3D environment. Additionally, it enhances the temporal and spatial resolution of thermal patterns predictions, offering rapid and detailed insights into various urban design alternatives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Catboost Regressor; Data-Driven Methods; Mean Radiant Temperature (T<sub>mrt</sub>); Urban Design; Urban Environmental Comfort","Sensitivity analysis; Catboost regressor; Data-driven methods; Environmental comfort; Mean radiant temperature; Thermal; Urban configurations; Urban design; Urban environmental comfort; Urban heat island; Thermal modeling","","","","","","","Shashua-Bar L., Hoffman M., Vegetation as a climatic component in the design of an urban street: An empirical model for predicting the cooling effect of urban green areas with trees, Energ.

In this study, we aimed to provide a quantitative design method for urban space design that could take into account the preferences of different populations. Through empirical research, we collected real urban space and population data, which we then quantified using advanced intelligent recognition tools based on deep learning techniques. Our ensuing analysis illuminated the intricate interplay between constituent elements of urban spaces and the structural and emotional changes of residents. By taking into account the specific driving relationships between each element and residents, we proposed a new evaluation methodology for constructing an intelligent design evaluation model for urban spaces. This intelligent design evaluation model was subsequently used to evaluate the urban space both pre- and post-design. The standard deviation of the difference results demonstrated that the design option (SD value = 0.103) and the desired option for Space 1 were lower than the current option (SD value = 0.129) and the expected scheme. Our findings provide quantitative configuration strategies and program evaluation for urban space design, thus helping designers to design urban spaces that are more popular with residents. © 2023 by the authors.","emotion perception; intelligent evaluation; resident effect; space elements; urban space","design method; perception; urban design; urban population","","","","","","","Wang D., Hua Q., Dai G., Research on user-centered scene design method, Chin.

For centuries, understanding these places has been limited to sporadic observations and laborious data collection. This study proposes a novel methodology to analyze citywide, discrete urban spaces using highly accurate anonymized telecom data and machine learning algorithms. Through superposition of human dynamics and urban features, this work aims to expose clear correlations between the design of the city and the behavioral patterns of its users. Geolocated telecom data, obtained for the state of Andorra, were initially analyzed to identify “stay-points”—events in which cellular devices remain within a certain roaming distance for a given length of time. These stay-points were then further analyzed to find clusters of activity characterized in terms of their size, persistence, and diversity. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify associations between the formation of these clusters and various urban features such as urban morphology or land-use within a 25–50 meters resolution. Some of the urban features that were found to be highly related to the creation of large, diverse and long-lasting clusters were the presence of service and entertainment amenities, natural water features, and the betweenness centrality of the road network; others, such as educational and park amenities were shown to have a negative impact. Ultimately, this study suggests a “reversed urbanism” methodology: an evidence-based approach to urban design, planning, and decision making, in which human behavioral patterns are instilled as a foundational design tool for inferring the success rates of highly performative urban places. © The Author(s) 2019.","human dynamics; machine learning; spatial analysis; telecom data; Urban design","decision making; machine learning; telecommunication; temporal record; urban design; urban development; urban morphology; urban planning","","","","","ACTUA; State of Andorra; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT","This study would not be possible without the collaboration between MIT and the State of Andorra.

When infested by the RPW, all untreated palms typically die. RPW monitoring is difficult, and when the pest is detected, management to save the infested palm becomes intricate. For this reason, an efficient and integrated RPW monitoring, such as a location-aware system (LAS), combined with the scientific knowledge of experts on the palm's physiology and the RPW biological cycle must be designed, developed and implemented. In the current study, an innovative integrated RPW management in urban landscapes under real conditions is presented. Based on the LAS, this study investigates the effectiveness of monitoring RPW infestations in palms, such as the Phoenix canariensis, under field conditions at the Pedion Areos park, which is located in central Athens, the capital of the Hellenic Republic. The goal of this study is to address the specific needs of RPW management and control by facilitating the treatment process adopted by experts combined with an appropriate spatial decision support system (SDSS), which accounts for the RPW population dynamics and spatio-temporal characteristics of the infested areas. The process of estimating the infestation risk is based on a ten-point scale classification, which is incorporated into the LAS. The results from the aforementioned moderate-scaled field experiment conducted for evaluation purposes showed that the LAS is an innovative, simple, and easy to use integrated platform that can be used for early detection, rapid monitoring and assessment of RPW in urban landscapes. Finally, the results from this four-year experiment showed that the diameter and height of the trunk of canary palms play a significant role in the susceptibility to RPW infestations and the recovery of infested canary palms; the results also demonstrated that control of RPW in urban landscapes is possible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Location-aware system; Mobile GIS; Red palm weevil; Spatial decision support system","Athens [Attica];

Compared to standard computer vision, satellite imagery is unique as images sampled from the data form a continuous array, rather than being fully independent. We argue that the spatial configuration of the images is as important as the content of each image when attempting to capture a pattern that reflects the structure of the urban environment. We propose a series of approaches explicitly incorporating spatial dimension in the predictive pipeline based on the EfficientNetB4 convolutional neural network (CNN) and experimentally test their effect on model performance. The experiments in this study cover the scale of the sampled area, the effect of spatial augmentation, and the role of modelling (logit ensemble and histogram-based gradient-boosted classifiers) with and without the spatial context on the outputs of the neural network-generated vector of probabilities while trying to predict spatial signatures, a classification of primarily urban landscape based on form and function. The results suggest that certain ways of embedding spatial information, especially in the modelling step, consistently significantly improve the prediction accuracy and shall be considered on top of standard CNNs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence;

To effectively utilize AI-generative design results for spatial vitality creation and evaluation, exploring whether generated spaces respond to people’s emotional demands is necessary. This study establishes a comparative framework analyzing emotional attachment characteristics between LoRA-generated spatial designs and the real urban vitality space, using the representative case of THE BOX in Chaoyang, Beijing. Empirical data were collected through structured on-site surveys with 115 validated participants, enabling a comprehensive emotional attachment evaluation. SPSS 26.0 was employed for multi-dimensional analyses, encompassing aggregate attachment intensity, dimensional differentiation, and correlation mapping. Key findings reveal that while both generative and original spatial representations elicit measurable positive responses, AI-generated designs demonstrate a limited capacity to replicate the authentic three-dimensional experiential qualities inherent to physical environments, particularly regarding structural articulation and material tactility. Furthermore, significant deficiencies persist in the generative design’s cultural semiotic expression and visual-interactive spatial legibility, resulting in diminished user satisfaction. The analysis reveals that LoRA-generated spatial solutions require strategic enhancements in dynamic visual hierarchy, interactive integration, chromatic optimization, and material fidelity to bridge this experiential gap. These insights suggest viable pathways for integrating generative AI methodologies with conventional urban design practices, potentially enabling more sophisticated hybrid approaches that synergize digital innovation with built environment realities to cultivate enriched multisensory spatial experiences. © 2025 by the authors.","AI-generative design; emotional attachment scales; emotional design; LoRA technology; urban vitality space","Chaoyang; China; Liaoning; artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; research; urban design; urban planning","","","","","Beijing Forestry University, BJFU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (52208005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF; Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation, (22GLC063, 230805329162932); Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation","Funding text 1: We would like to thank to all the people including onsite users and online participants for supporting our research.

The research team developed a preliminary method for using observational analysis and real-time object detection to study pedestrian engagement with public art. A custom machine-learning script was developed in Python based on open-source YOLOv3, an algorithm first described by Redmon et al. By building on Redmon et al.’s work, we increased the reliability and validity of our own custom script, which was tested on a range of walking conditions both at our site and using stock video footage of streets in other locales. Video recordings of pedestrian movements near sculptural artwork on Tufts campus captured by a low-tech security camera were run through the algorithm to generate path diagram images of passersby the artwork, enabling the research team to select videos where pedestrian behaviors of interest occur for empirical review. Research results evidence social walking behavior (groups of two or more) and proximity to walking path (adjacent to the sidewalk) are correlated with greater pedestrian engagement with artwork (looking at the art). These interdisciplinary methods successfully selected videos where pedestrians engaged with public artwork, verifying AI technologies are a promising research tool for studying walking behavior in a more data-driven way than has been done previously. Quantitative measures of pedestrian responses to public art can help urban planners and designers to promote art’s benefits including walkability, quality-of-life, and well-being. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Public art; Walkability; YOLOv3","algorithm; art; artificial intelligence; image analysis; interdisciplinary approach; neighborhood; pedestrian; urban design; urban planning; visual analysis; walking","","","","","Data Intensive Study Center at Tufts University","Funding for this research provided by the Data Intensive Study Center at Tufts University.

While urban planning and design are known to influence road safety, it is not clear how features of the built environment contribute to traffic fatalities. In this study, we analyze road fatality data from 106 cities across six continents via a combination of computer vision and unsupervised clustering on 26.8 million Google Street View images. We use deep learning tools to extract 25 features from the images. Among these features, 19 are relatively static built environment features, and 6 are dynamic usage-related features (such as pedestrians, cars, buses, and bikes). On the basis of the built environment features, we group the urban streetscapes into six distinct visual clusters. We then examine how these clusters are related to city-level road fatality rates when various control variables (e.g., population size, carbon emissions, income, road length, road safety policy, and continent) and dynamic features are combined. Our findings show that cities with Open Arterials streetscape (extensive road surface, open-sky views, and railings) tend to have higher road fatality rates. After accounting for differences in the built environment, cities with better public transit (proxied by buses detected) tend to have fewer traffic deaths—specifically, a 1% increase in bus presence is linked to a 0.35% decrease in fatalities per 100,000 people. This study demonstrates the power of using widely available street view imagery to uncover global disparities in urban design and their connection to road safety. © 2025 The Authors","Built environment; Image analysis; Road safety; Streetscape; Urban design; Urban visual clusters","Buses; Deep learning; Highway accidents; Highway planning; Mass transportation; Motor transportation; Pedestrian safety; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Built environment; Fatality rates; Global cities; Image analyze; Image-analysis; Road safety; Road transports; Streetscape; Urban design; Urban visual cluster; Image analysis","","","","","Research Grant Council General Research Fund, (17616221)","This research is funded by the Research Grant Council General Research Fund (No. 17616221) and is an initiative of the HKU Joint Laboratory on Future Cities.","Ahmad Almasi S., Behnood H.R., Arvin R., Pedestrian crash exposure analysis using alternative geographically weighted regression models, J.

The water distribution network (WDN) is one of the most important urban infrastructures in which optimal design and operation of it is essential during the operation period. For this purpose, in this research, artificial intelligence and data mining methods, including genetic programming (GP), gene expression programming (GEP), artificial neural network (ANN), and discrete wavelet transform function, are used to predict the daily drinking water consumption values of WDN. For this purpose, a dataset of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and daily water value of Najaf-Abad city in Iran is used during year 2014 to 2019. Here, hybrid models named W-GEP, W-GP, W-ANN, are proposed by equipping GEP, GP, and ANN with a wavelet transform function. In addition, two formulations are proposed for each model. Performance of proposed methods is investigated by determining R2, RMSE, and NSE statistical indices. For the training data of the W-GP model, the RMSE, NSE, and R2 values are 2810.46 (m3/day), 0.85, and 0.85, respectively, while for test and validation data these values are 2638.92 (m3/day), 0.87, and 0.87, respectively. Results show the good performance of proposed methods. In addition, the discrete wavelet transform function improves the models’ performance, in which the best results obtained by using the W-GEP model. © The Author(s) 2025.","Demand; Discrete wavelet transform function; Intelligent methods; Water distribution network","Esfahan [Iran]; Iran; Najafabad; Discrete wavelet transforms; Intelligent systems; Water distribution systems; Demand; Discrete wavelet transform function; Discrete-wavelet-transform; Gene-expression programming; Intelligent method; Neural-networks; Performance; Transform function; Urban infrastructure; Water distribution networks; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; data mining; drinking water; transform; urban design; water demand; wavelet analysis; Genetic programming","","","","","","","Brentan B.M., Luvizotto E., Herrera M., Izquierdo J., Perez-Garcia R., Hybrid regression model for near real-time urban water demand forecasting, J Comput Appl Math, 309, pp. 532-541, (2017); Dolatabadi M., Ghorbanian A., Ahmadzadeh S., Mg–Al–layered double hydroxide as promising sustainable nanoadsorbent for application in water/wastewater treatment processes; diethyl phthalate removal, J Environ Health Sustain Develop, 6, pp. 1367-1375, (2021); Dolatabadi M., Ehrampoush M.H., Pournamdari M., Ebrahimi A.A., Fallahzadeh H., Ahmadzadeh S., Simultaneous electrochemical degradation of pesticides from the aqueous environment using Ti/SnO2–Sb2O3/PbO2/Bi electrode; process modeling and mechanism insight, Chemosphere, 311, (2023); Ferreira C., Gene expression programming: a new adaptive algorithm for solving problems, arXiv preprint cs/0102027, (2001); Gao R.X., Yan R., From Fourier Transform to Wavelet Transform: A Historical Perspective: Wavelets: Theory and Applications for Manufacturing (Springer US), pp, 17–32, (2011); 2021) Weather data request system, [online] Available at; Kavya M., Mathew A., Shekar P.R., Sarwesh P., Short term water demand forecast modelling using artificial intelligence for smart water management, Sustain Cities Soc, 95, (2023); Kuhnert C., Gonuguntla N.M., Krieg H., Nowak D., Thomas J.A., Application of LSTM networks for water demand prediction in optimal pump control, Water, 13, 5, (2021); Namdari H., AshrafiS S.M., Haghighi A., Deep learning–based short-term water demand forecasting in urban areas: A hybrid multichannel model, AQUA - Water Infrastruct Ecosyst Soc, 73, 3, pp. 380-395, (2024); Niknam A., Zare H.K., Hosseininasab H., Mostafaeipour A., Herrera M., A critical review of short-term water demand forecasting tools—What method should i use?, Sustainability, 14, 9, (2022); Noorbeh P., Roozbahani A., KardanMoghaddam H., Annual and monthly dam inflow prediction using bayesian networks, Water Resour Manage, 34, 9, pp. 2933-2951, (2020); Pacchin E., Gagliardi F., Alvisi S., Franchini M., A comparison of short-term water demand forecasting models, Water Resour Manage, 33, 4, pp. 1481-1497, (2019); Romano G., Salvati N., Guerrini A., Estimating the determinants of residential water demand in Italy, Water, 6, pp. 2929-2945, (2014); Sebri M., Forecasting urban water demand: A meta-regression analysis, J Environ Manage, 183, pp. 777-785, (2016); Shabani S., Candelieri A., Archetti F., Naser G., Gene expression programming coupled with unsupervised learning: a two-stage learning process in multi-scale, short-term water demand forecasts, Water, 10, 2, (2018); Shuang Q., Zhao R.T., Water demand prediction using machine learning methods: a case study of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region in China, Water, 13, 3, (2021); Smolak K., Kasieczka B., Fialkiewicz W., Rohm W., Sila-Nowicka K., Kopanczyk K., Applying human mobility and water consumption data for short-term water demand forecasting using classical and machine learning models, Urban Water J, 17, 1, pp. 32-42, (2020); Vanneschi L., Poli R., Genetic programming—introduction, applications, theory and open issues, Handbook of natural computing, pp. 709-739, (2012); 2021) Water and waste water company of Isfahan province, [online] Available at; Xenochristou M., Kapelan Z., An ensemble stacked model with bias correction for improved water demand forecasting, Urban Water J, 17, 3, pp. 212-223, (2020); Zarrin Z., Hamidi O., Amini P., Maryanaji Z., Predicting the pulse of urban water demand: a machine learning approach to deciphering meteorological influences, BMC Res Notes, 17, (2024); Zubaidi S.L., Hashim K., Ethaib S., Al-Bdairi N.S.S., Al-Bugharbee H., Gharghan S.K., A novel methodology to predict monthly municipal water demand based on weather variables scenario, J King Saud Univ - Eng Sci, 34, 3, pp. 163-169, (2022)","R.

In addition, available public participation computational tools focus mainly on information and idea sharing, leaving the public excluded in design generation because of their lack of design expertise. To address such an issue, this study develops Urban-GAN, a plural urban design computation system, to provide new technical support for design empowerment, allowing the public to generate their own designs. The sub-symbolic representation and artificial intelligence techniques of deep convolutional neural networks, case-based reasoning, and generative adversarial networks are used to acquire and embody design knowledge as the density function, and generate design schemes with this knowledge. The system consists of an urban form database and five process models through which the user with little design expertise can select urban form cases, generate designs similar to those cases, and make design decisions. The Urban-GAN is applied to hypothetical design experiments, which show that the user is able to apply the system to successfully generate distinctive designs following the urban form “styles” in Manhattan, Portland, and Shanghai. This study further extends the discussion about the plural urban design computation to general reflections on the goals and values in AI technique application in planning and design. © The Author(s) 2022.","case-based reasoning; deep learning; design empowerment; generative adversarial networks; perceptive performance; urban form style","artificial intelligence; computer aided design; empowerment; perception; performance assessment; urban design","","","","","Collegiate Schools of Planning; Canadian Political Science Association, ACSP; Seoul National University, SNU; Ministry of Education, MOE, (5120200113713); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2018R1C1B5043758); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is supported by the Creative-Pioneering Researchers Program through Seoul National University (SNU), the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT) (No. 2018R1C1B5043758), and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Education) (No. 5120200113713).

A hybrid approach enables stakeholders to actively define their city’s future by simulating several re-design scenarios utilizing AI data management. This interactive representation of possible results enables well-informed decision-making, where the advantages and limitations are carefully considered, guaranteeing that the re-design aligns with the requirements and needs of the local communities. This integrative method promotes openness and a feeling of responsibility, establishing the basis for resilient urban environments that emerge from conflict. METHODS: The study establishes a foundation for using Artificial Intelligence technologies to solve complex urban development challenges by critically examining existing approaches for urban re-design after the war and promoting interventions powered by Artificial Intelligence-driven processes. This study aims to contribute to the field of post-war rebuilding of urban landscapes by developing a solution that can be generalized. This study adopts a qualitative methodology approach to investigate the possible integration of Artificial Intelligence in re-designing urban landscapes post-war. The methodology is structured to examine existing approaches and studies of post-war urban recovery, compare traditional and AI-assisted approaches, and propose a hybrid approach that combines both. The study structure is a literature review and theoretical approach development, data collection, and analysis, depending on multiple sources, including government reports and academic research, as well as hybrid approach development. FINDINGS: The discussion provides theoretical evidence of the potential advances in this empirical approach, highlighting the efficiency improvements achievable by using Artificial Intelligence technologies in a hybrid phased approach that integrates traditional post-war processes with Artificial Intelligence-assisted ones. The study also highlights the importance of ethical considerations in Artificial Intelligence restoration procedures, addressing acceptance, community involvement, and cultural heritage safeguarding concerns. This emphasis on ethics reassures the audience about Artificial Intelligence’s responsible and conscientious use in post-war re-design. CONCLUSION: The study explores the potential integration of Artificial Intelligence in re-designing postwar urban landscapes. It compares conventional methods of urban revival with innovative Artificial Intelligence-supported methods to determine the advantages of utilizing Artificial Intelligence in post-war urban re-design. Traditional techniques for gathering data, allocating resources, and engaging the community have many challenges that negatively affect the effectiveness of re-designing and re-design measures. This study suggests that integrating Artificial Intelligence with traditional strategies can help overcome these challenges by analyzing extensive datasets, which leads to effective decision-making. A hybrid approach combining conventional and Artificial Intelligence-supported methods is suggested to improve the resiliency and sustainability of the re-designing process. It aims to enhance resource distribution and strategic planning through Artificial Intelligence-assisted strategies. ©2025 The author(s).","AI-assisted design approach; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Conventional design approach; Data management; Post-war redesign","","","","","","Department of Architecture; Aqaba for Technology University; Architecture Engineering Department; Nahda University","This study was done while the authors were faculty members.

The model is formulated as a Random Forest classifier that predicts the mode-duration probabilities of a given trip. A novel series of predictor features are proposed which measure the urban form, demographics, and service densities on different scales of the transportation network. Through a sensitivity analysis and a proof-of-concept case study, we find that a dense, mixed-use environment with good coverage of a multi-modal mobility network can significantly promote active transportation and public transit use. However, we also find that ultra-dense, centralized developments can lead to increased travel time and increased vehicle use in the urban periphery. Our modeling and analysis method provides a simplified and effective way to assess urban design and planning scenarios from different mobility perspectives and facilitates data-driven, mobility-aware urban design and planning that can help identify better solutions more quickly. © The Author(s) 2023.","machine learning; planning; travel behavior; urban design; urban mobility","machine learning; mobility; public transport; sensitivity analysis; transportation infrastructure; travel behavior; travel time; urban design; urban planning","","","","","CFDA, (20.701, 69A3551747119); California Department of Transportation, CT; Council of Fashion Designers of America, CFDA","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by The Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health (CTECH) and Federal Government CFDA #: 20.701 (69A3551747119). ; Funding text 2: We thank the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) for providing geocoded NHTS travel survey data.

However, the usage and user experiences of greenways are often challenging to measure because it is costly to survey such large areas. Based on the online postings from Instagram in 2017, this paper used Computer Vision (CV) technology to analyze and compare how the general public uses two typical greenway parks, The High Line in New York City and the Atlanta Beltline in Atlanta. Face and object detection analysis were conducted to infer user composition, activities, and key experiences. We presented the temporal patterns of Instagram postings as well as the group gatherings, smiling, and representative objects detected from photos. Our results have shown high user engagement levels for both parks while teens are significantly underrepresented. The High Line had more group activities and was more active during weekdays than the Atlanta Beltline. Stronger sense of escape and physical activities can be found in Atlanta Beltline. In summary, social media images like Instagram can provide strong empirical evidence for urban greenway usage when combined with artificial intelligence technologies, which can support the future practice of landscape architecture and urban design. © The Author(s) 2022.","computer vision; park usage; place quality; social media; Urban greenway","Atlanta; Georgia; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; artificial intelligence; comparative study; computer vision; greenspace; social media; temporal variation; urban area","","","","","College of Architecture Faculty Startup Fund; National Science Foundation, NSF, (OAC-2112356, SMA-2122054); National Science Foundation, NSF; Texas A and M University, TAMU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants SMA-2122054 and OAC-2112356, Texas A&M University Harold L.

However, there is a scarcity of understanding of nighttime safety despite the fast-growing body of urban scene auditing research based on daytime street view imagery (SVI). To fill the gap, this study collected ∼1000 pairwise day-and-night SVIs to train a day-to-night (D2N) SVI generator to effectively predict nighttime SVI based on daytime counterpart using generative adversarial network (GAN). The accuracy of fake nighttime image was evaluated with commonly-used GAN metrics (e.g., structural similarity index, inception score) and human validation. Then, an online visual survey with 46 participants was conducted to collect their perceived safety on street scenes during daytime and nighttime (D&N), and the results become training labels for machine learning models to predict D&N safety perceptions. Our results revealed significant discrepancies in D&N safety perception. First, through correlation analysis, we found that the sky and building features matter to the prediction accuracy of generated nighttime SVIs. Second, the micro-level streetscape features (e.g., pavements, roads, and buildings) play influential roles in perceived safety. Third, higher safety perceptions are consistently found in areas with higher building density regardless of whether they are daytime or night. In contrast, untended trees and grass reduce perceived safety at night. This study provides a valuable reference for improving the accuracy of generating nighttime images from daytime SVIs. It also reveals how streetscapes affect D&N safety perceptions in high-density cities like Hong Kong, providing empirical evidence for urban design policies to facilitate nighttime attractiveness and prosperity. © 2024 The Authors","Day-to-night translation; Hong Kong; Nighttime urban scene; Safety perception; Street view imagery (SVI)","","","","","","University of Hong Kong, HKU; Faculty of Architecture; Department of Urban Planning and Design","This research is supported by the University of Hong Kong's URC Seed Fund for Basic Research for New Staff, and Start-up Fund from Faculty of Architecture (FOA) and the Department of Urban Planning and Design (DUPAD).

We employ an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach on publicly accessible Airbnb data to identify optimal Airbnb rental features, predict price trends, and understand Airbnb's growth in Dublin. Our analysis also integrates features from three main categories: physical geography (e.g., elevation), social geography (e.g., Electoral Division), and infrastructure & economic geography based on housing/rental market theories (e.g., distance from the city centre). This integration of geographical attributes with ML algorithms provides localised insights into Airbnb pricing dynamics, addressing gaps in previous research that often overlooked the impact of geographical features on price prediction. By applying the TreeSHAP utility (tree-based attribute for SHapley Additive exPlanations), we establish the significant role of these geographical features in predicting Airbnb rental prices, thereby reinforcing theories like Alonso's Bid-Rent Theory. We further validate the robustness of our models through testing procedures. Our study offers considerable value to urban planners, policymakers, urban researchers, and market stakeholders, deepening the understanding of Airbnb's impact on urban landscapes and contributing to the broader discourse on the Sharing Economy. © 2024 The Authors","Airbnb; Dublin; Machine Learning; Sharing Economy; XAI","Circular economy; Airbnb; Dublin; Geographical features; Ireland; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Publicly accessible; Sharing economy; Urban characteristics; XAI; Adversarial machine learning","","","","","","","Abdar M., Yen N.Y., Analysis of user preference and expectation on shared economy platform: Examining correlation between points of interest on Airbnb, Computers in Human Behavior, 107, (2020); Adamiak C., Szyda B., Dubownik A., Garcia-Alvarez D., Airbnb offer in Spain—Spatial analysis of the pattern and determinants of its distribution, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-information, 8, 3, (2019); Alonso W., A theory of the urban land market, Papers in Regional Science, 6, 1, pp. 149-157, (1960); Bei G., Celata F., Challenges and effects of short-term rentals regulation: A counterfactual assessment of European cities, Annals of Tourism Research, 101, (2023); Berentsen A., Breu M.R., Waller C., (2019); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Chang C., Li S., Study of price determinants of sharing economy-based accommodation services: Evidence from Airbnb.com, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 16, 4, pp. 584-601, (2020); Chang C., Lin C., LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, 3, pp. 1-27, (2011); Chen H., Janizek J.D., Lundberg S., (2020); Chen T., (2016); Chica-Olmo J., Morales J.G.G., Gomez J.L., Effects of location on Airbnb apartment pricing in Málaga, Tourism Management, 77, (2020); Clancy M., Tourism, financialization, and short-term rentals: The political economy of Dublin's housing crisis, Current Issues in Tourism, 25, 20, pp. 3363-3380, (2020); (2018); Cortes C., Vapnik V., Support-vector networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Covert I., (2020); Credit K., Spatial models or random forest?

The advancement of artificial intelligence has substantially increased convenience for individuals. This research proposes an urban landscape layout model powered by artificial intelligence that automatically generates urban landscape design based on deep learning (URDDL) with two dimensions: emotional tendency and urban landscape appraisal. The input image represents land use and surrounding road conditions, while the output image depicts the selection of the main entrance and the internal spatial function layout. The Pix2Pix model is trained to learn the internal function layout based on varying land use and road conditions. Additionally, a domain-specific dictionary is constructed using an existing semantic resource vocabulary, where positive and negative sentiment words are compared with their corresponding sentiment values, focusing on categories such as Stimulate, Sense, and Action. Experimental results indicate that the absolute average error of the URDDL model is 91.31%, with a maximum error of 96.87%. The degree of fit is highly appropriate for evaluating the emotional prediction of urban landscapes. The findings demonstrate that the URDDL model outperforms traditional design methods regarding generated results, suggesting its potential for future applications in automated landscape design. © (2024), (PeerJ Inc.).

We propose a novel, complementary use of deep neural networks and planning guidance to automate street network generation that can be context-aware, learning-based, and user-guided. The model tests suggest that the incorporation of planning knowledge (e.g., road junctions and neighborhood types) in the model training leads to a more realistic prediction of street configurations. Furthermore, the new tool provides both professional and lay users an opportunity to systematically and intuitively explore benchmark proposals for comparisons and further evaluations. © 2021 The Society of Urban Technology.","applied urban model;

By converting pixels into Cubixels, we can analyze the image’s 3D properties, thereby enriching image processing and computer vision tasks. Utilizing Cubixels, we’ve developed algorithms for advanced image segmentation, edge detection, texture analysis, and feature extraction, yielding a deeper comprehension of image content. Our empirical experimental results on benchmark images and datasets showcase the applicability of these concepts. Further, we discuss future applications of Cubixels and VoV in various domains, particularly in medical imaging, where they have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic processes. By interpreting images as complex ‘urban landscapes’, we envision a new frontier for deep learning models that simulate and learn from diverse environmental conditions. The integration of Cubixels into deep learning architectures promises to revolutionize the field, providing a pathway towards more intelligent, context-aware artificial intelligence systems. With this groundbreaking work, we aim to inspire future research that will unlock the full potential of image data, transforming both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

A comprehensive assessment of urban landscapes is crucial for guiding the development of inclusive, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements. Previous studies have primarily analyzed two-dimensional landscape indicators derived from satellite remote sensing, potentially overlooking the valuable insights provided by the three-dimensional configuration of landscapes. This limitation arises from the high cost of acquiring large-area three-dimensional data and the lack of effective assessment indicators. Here, we propose four urban landscapes indicators in three dimensions (UL3D): greenness, grayness, openness, and crowding. We construct the UL3D using 4.03 million street view images from 303 major cities in China, employing a deep learning approach. We combine urban background and two-dimensional urban landscape indicators with UL3D to predict the socioeconomic profiles of cities. The results show that UL3D indicators differs from two-dimensional landscape indicators, with a low average correlation coefficient of 0.31 between them. Urban landscapes had a changing point in 2018–2019 due to new urbanization initiatives, with grayness and crowding rates slowing, while openness increased. The incorporation of UL3D indicators significantly enhances the explanatory power of the regression model for predicting socioeconomic profiles. Specifically, GDP per capita, urban population rate, built-up area per capita, and hospital count correspond to improvements of 25.0%, 19.8%, 35.5%, and 19.2%, respectively. These findings indicate that UL3D indicators have the potential to reflect the socioeconomic profiles of cities. © 2024 Science China Press","Deep learning; Landscape pattern; Street view images; Three-dimensional landscape indicators","Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Comprehensive assessment; Deep learning; Landscape indicators; Landscape pattern; Per capita; Socio-economics; Street view image; Three-dimensional landscape indicator; Two-dimensional; Urban landscape; Deep learning","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFF1303101); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFF1303101).

The study investigates two case studies: Perugia, Italy, and Oslo, Norway. Utilizing street-level imagery processed through semantic segmentation, the research quantifies the urban environment using metrics such as the Green View Index (GVI), Sky View Factor (SVF), and Building View Factor (BVF). Perugia, with its historical architecture and compact medieval urban fabric, reveals a concentration of greenery in peripheral zones, with limited green visibility in its dense city center. In contrast, Oslo displays a more uniform integration of green spaces, ensuring high accessibility even within its central urban areas. These disparities reflect differing urban histories, geographic layouts, and planning approaches, emphasizing the challenges of achieving equitable green space distribution in varied contexts. The findings underscore the pivotal role of green spaces in promoting psychological and physical health by mitigating urban stress and enhancing relaxation. The study also highlights the constraints of utilizing proprietary data sources such as Google Street View, advocating for the development of open-access and equitable data frameworks. This research contributes to the field by proposing a scalable and transferable AI-driven methodology for urban landscape evaluation. The results provide actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers aimed at fostering sustainable and livable cities. © 2024 University of L'Aquila, Department of Civil Construction, Building and Architecture, Environmental Engineering.

The study proposes a non-parametric approach that uses machine learning models to predict road running intensity. The models were developed using route check-in data from Keep, a mobile exercise application, and street geographic information data in Beijing’s core district. The results show that blue space and trail continuity are the most important factors in improving road running intensity. There is an optimum design value for the sky openness and the street enclosure, which need to be balanced with shade while meeting the light of the road. And it is also important to provide appropriate visual permeability. Furthermore, unlike daily activities, it was found that higher function mixture and function density did not have significant positive effects on the road running intensity.

However, planning for active mobility is a complex endeavour due to numerous local, place-based factors that influence active mobility decisions. Recent advancements in urban data research have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning methods in evaluating active mobility potential for urban environments. At present, the incorporation of semantic information from deep learning models and street view imagery into spatio-temporal contexts remains a challenge. In particular, knowledge extraction from deep learning models remains an open question for urban planning and decision-making. Towards this issue, we propose a functional deep learning and network science workflow that employs open data from OpenStreetMap and Mapillary to assess factors affecting active mobility decisions and route planning. We demonstrate the generalisability of our analytical workflow through two case studies focusing on urban greenery in Nerima city (Japan) and urban visual complexity in Pasir Ris town (Singapore). Our results reveal clear patterns of heterogeneity in urban streetscapes and identify unevenness in street infrastructure provision based on destination types. Using this information, we propose specific areas for design intervention to improve active mobility planning. Our workflow is applicable for a diverse range of use cases making it relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, not limited to, urban researchers, policy makers and urban planners. © The Author(s) 2022.","Computer vision; machine learning; urban analytics; volunteered geographic information; walking behaviour","Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Nerima; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Tokyo [Kanto]; Tokyo [Tokyo (PRF)]; computer vision; decision making; GIS; machine learning; mobility; network analysis; urban design; urban planning; walking","","","","","National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-295-000-171-133)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore Grant (R-295-000-171-133).","Agryzkov T., Tortosa L., Vicent J.F., A variant of the current flow betweenness centrality and its application in urban networks, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 347, pp. 600-615, (2019); Alvarez Leon L.F., Quinn S., The value of crowdsourced street-level imagery: examining the shifting property regimes of openstreetcam and mapillary, GeoJournal, 84, pp. 395-414, (2019); Anselin L., Rey S.J., Open source software for spatial data science, Geographical Analysis, 54, pp. 429-438, (2022); Arnold H.F., Et al., Trees in urban design, Trees in Urban Design, (1980); Arribas-Bel D., Green M., Rowe F., Et al., Open data products-a framework for creating valuable analysis ready data, Journal of Geographical Systems, 23, pp. 497-514, (2021); Banerjee T., Uhm J., Bahl D., Walking to school: the experience of children in inner city los angeles and implications for policy, Journal of Planning Education and Research, 34, pp. 123-140, (2014); Basu R., Sevtsuk A., How do street attributes affect willingness-to-walk?

Deep learning techniques tackle urban complexity and diversity, which unlocks a broad range of applications. These include urban planning, transportation management, autonomous driving, and smart city efforts. Through rich context and insights, semantic segmentation helps decision-makers and stakeholders make educated decisions for sustainable and effective urban development. This study investigates an in-depth exploration of cityscape image segmentation using the U-Net deep learning model. The proposed U-Net architecture comprises an encoder and decoder structure. The encoder uses convolutional layers and down sampling to extract hierarchical information from input images. Each down sample step reduces spatial dimensions, and increases feature depth, aiding context acquisition. Batch normalization and dropout layers stabilize models and prevent overfitting during encoding. The decoder reconstructs higher-resolution feature maps using ""UpSampling2D"" layers. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation of the Cityscapes dataset, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the U-Net model in achieving state-of-the-art results in image segmentation. The results clearly shown that, the proposed model has high accuracy, mean IOU and mean DICE compared to existing models. © 2024 Arulananth et al.

While previous research has identified that the composition of urban landscapes influences the physical properties of the environment such as surface temperature, a generalizable and flexible framework is needed that can be used to compare cities across time and space. This study employs the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) classification combined with remote sensing of New York City’s land surface temperature (LST). These are then linked using machine learning and statistical modeling to identify how greenspace and the built environment influence urban surface temperature. Further, changes in urban structure are then connected to changes in LST over time. It was observed that areas with urban units composed of largely the built environment hosted the hottest temperatures while those with vegetation and water were coolest. Likewise, this is reinforced by borough-level spatial differences in both urban structure and heat. Comparison of these relationships over the period between 2008 and 2017 identified changes in surface temperature that are likely due to the changes in the presence of water, low-rise buildings, and pavement across the city. This research reinforces how human alteration of the environment changes LST and offers units of analysis that can be used for research and urban planning. © The Author(s) 2022.","new york city; spatial-temporal change; Structure of urban landscapes; surface temperature; urban structure","New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; greenspace; spatiotemporal analysis; surface temperature; urban area; urban design; urban development","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1832407)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project is funded by NSF award # 1832407.

OMS, as a key element in modern urban design, significantly enhances residents’ quality of life and promotes public health. Accurately understanding and predicting users’ emotional needs is the core challenge in optimizing OMS. In this study, the Kansei Engineering (KE) framework is applied, using fuzzy clustering to reduce the dimensionality of emotional descriptors, while RST is employed for attribute reduction to select five key design features that influence users’ emotions. Subsequently, the PSO-SVR model is applied to establish the nonlinear mapping relationship between these design features and users’ emotions, predicting the optimal configuration of OMS design. The results indicate that the optimized OMS design significantly enhances users’ intention to stay in the space, as reflected by higher ratings for emotional descriptors and increased preferences for longer outdoor activity duration, all exceeding the median score of the scale. Additionally, comparative analysis shows that the PSO-SVR model outperforms traditional methods (e.g., BPNN, RF, and SVR) in terms of accuracy and generalization for predictions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the emotional performance of OMS design and offers a solid optimization framework along with practical guidance for future urban public space design. The innovative contribution of this study lies in the proposed data-driven optimization method that integrates machine learning and KE. This method not only offers a new theoretical perspective for OMS design but also establishes a scientific framework to accurately incorporate users’ emotional needs into the design process. The method contributes new knowledge to the field of urban design, promotes public health and well-being, and provides a solid foundation for future applications in different urban environments. © 2024 by the authors.","Kansei engineering; outdoor micro-space; PSO-SVR algorithm; rough set theory; urban design","Architectural design; Behavioral research; Dimensionality reduction; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy set theory; Machine design; Space applications; Structural dynamics; Support vector regression; Urban planning; Vector spaces; Activity duration; Kansei Engineering; Outdoor micro-space; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization–support vector regression algorithm; Sets theory; Space design; Support vector regression algorithms; Swarm optimization; Urban design; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","","","Tracking Program for Specially Appointed Professors, (1400152019)","This research was funded by Tracking Program for Specially Appointed Professors (Oriental Scholars) in Shanghai Universities, grant number 1400152019.","Bull F.C., Al-Ansari S.S., Biddle S., Borodulin K., Buman M.P., Cardon G., Carty C., Chaput J.-P., Chastin S., Chou R., World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, Br.

Manual dataset generation methods are costly, so automatic generation is preferred. However, previous methods are costly and are more reliant on 3D real-city models than LOD2. The objective of this research is to propose a method for automatically generating synthetic datasets for instance segmentation using an image translation technique and procedural modeling. The image translation technique is used to generate street view images for training data, and procedural modeling can automatically specify the composition of generated street view images and generate annotation data, as well as a variety of 3D models. The proposed method generates various kinds of synthetic data at a rate of 4.45 s per set, and the model trained on the generated dataset can detect real buildings for each instance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic dataset generation; Cityscape analysis; Computer-aided architectural design; Image-to-image translation; Instance segmentation; Streetscape dataset; Synthetic dataset","3D modeling; Computer aided analysis; Image segmentation; 3d-modeling; Automatic dataset generation; Cityscape analyse; Computer-aided architectural designs; Generation method; Image translation; Image-to-image translation; Instance segmentation; Streetscape dataset; Synthetic datasets; Deep learning","","","","","","","Kido D., Fukuda T., Yabuki N., Assessing future landscapes using enhanced mixed reality with semantic segmentation by deep learning, Adv.

The current study aims to compare two methodologies to identify urban indicators of the residents’ well-being focusing on three transects across two local watersheds in Jacksonville. The study is framed within the theory of transect analysis. The goal of this experiment was to compare an analogical transect analysis method (AT) to Machine Learning one (MLT) to understand (1) what kind of contribution the latter approach can provide to the development of transect analysis methodologies, and (2) if and how it can connect digitally generated site analysis to local knowledge. The experiment’s findings highlight the ability of the ML algorithms to find noticeable patterns of built environment from aerial imagery. However, local knowledge is indispensable to interpret results in a meaningful way. The combination of the two approaches emphasizes the complementary nature of them and shows how ML methods can be a tool at the service of communities. © 2023, Maggioli S.p.a..

Understanding these perceptions may be useful to inform the design, management and planning process of public spaces. Recently, several studies have used data collected at a massive scale and machine learning methods to quantify these perceptions, showing promising results in terms of predictive performance. Nevertheless, most of these models can be of little help in understanding users’ perceptions due to the difficulty associated with identifying the importance of each attribute of landscapes. In this work, we propose a novel approach to quantify perceptions of landscapes through discrete choice models, using semantic segmentations of images of public spaces, generated through machine learning algorithms, as explanatory variables. The proposed models are estimated using the Place Pulse dataset, with over 1.2 million perceptual indicators, and are able to provide useful insights into how users perceive the built environment as a function of its features. The models obtained are used to infer perceptual variables in the city of Santiago, Chile, and show they have a significant correlation with socioeconomic indicators. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Discrete choice models; Machine learning; Perceptions; Public spaces","Chile; Metropolitana; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Semantics; Sensory perception; Discrete choice models; Explanatory variables; Machine learning methods; Predictive performance; Public space; Semantic segmentation; Socio-economic indicators; Subjective perceptions; discrete choice analysis; machine learning; perception; performance assessment; planning process; prediction; public space; segmentation; urban design; Learning algorithms","","","","","Volvo Research and Educational Foundations, VREF; Instituto de Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería, ISCI, (FBO16); Instituto de Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería, ISCI; Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, CEDEUS, (CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020); Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, CEDEUS","This research was partially funded by the Complex Engineering Systems Institute , ISCI (ICM: P-05-004-F, CONICYT:FBO16), the Centre for Sustainable Urban Development , CEDEUS (CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020), and the BRT + Centre of Excellence funded by the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations ( VREF ).","Adler P., Falk C., Friedler S.A., Rybeck G., Scheidegger C., Smith B., Venkatasubramanian S., Auditing black-box models for indirect influence, 2016 IEEE 16th international conference on data mining (ICDM), pp. 1-10, (2016); Antonakos C.L., Environmental and travel preferences of cyclists, Transprtation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 29, 1, (1995); Badrinarayanan V., Kendall A., Cipolla R., pp. 1-14, (2015); Bierlaire M., BIOGEME: A free package for the estimation of discrete choice models, Swiss transport research conference, pp. 1-27, (2003); Bollen K.A., Latent variables in psychology and the social sciences, Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 605-634, (2002); Bonaiuto M., Fornara F., Bonnes M., Indexes of perceived residential environment quality and neighbourhood attachment in urban environments: A confirmation study on the city of Rome, Landscape and Urban Planning, 65, 1-2, pp. 41-52, (2003); Borsboom D., Mellenbergh G.J., van Heerden J., The theoretical status of latent variables, Psychological Review, 110, 2, pp. 203-219, (2003); Brostow G.J., Fauqueur J., Cipolla R., Semantic object classes in video: A high-definition ground truth database, Pattern Recognition Letters, 30, 2, pp. 88-97, (2009); Canas I., Ayuga E., Ayuga F., A contribution to the assessment of scenic quality of landscapes based on preferences expressed by the public, Land Use Policy, 26, 4, pp. 1173-1181, (2009); Canny J., A computational approach to edge detection, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, PAMI-, 8, 6, pp. 679-698, (1986); Cetintahra G.E., Cubukcu E., The influence of environmental aesthetics on economic value of housing: An empirical research on virtual environments, Journal of Housing and the Built Environment, 30, 2, pp. 331-340, (2015); Clifton K., Ewing R., Knaap G., Song Y., Quantitative analysis of urban form: A multidisciplinary review, Journal of Urbanism: International Research on Placemaking and Urban Sustainability, 1, 1, pp. 17-45, (2008); Crystal J.H., Brush R.O., Measuring scenic quality at the urban fringe, Landscape Research, 3, 3, pp. 9-14, (1978); de la Fuente de Val G., Atauri J.A., de Lucio J.V., Relationship between landscape visual attributes and spatial pattern indices: A test study in Mediterranean-climate landscapes, Landscape and Urban Planning, 77, 4, pp. 393-407, (2006); Domencich T., McFadden D., Urban travel demand: A behavioral analysis, (1975); Dramstad W.E., Tveit M.S., Fjellstad W.J., Fry G.L., Relationships between visual landscape preferences and map-based indicators of landscape structure, Landscape and Urban Planning, 78, 4, pp. 465-474, (2006); Dubey A., Naik N., Parikh D., Raskar R., Hidalgo C.A., Deep learning the city: Quantifying urban perception at a global scale, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 9905, pp. 196-212, (2016); Foster S., Hooper P., Knuiman M., Bull F., Giles-Corti B., Are liveable neighbourhoods safer neighbourhoods?

Designed to analyze tweets related to crises, conflicts, and tragedies, the system maps emotional states to neuroemotion processes, enabling emotion-aware urban analytics for real-time monitoring of public sentiment in high-stress scenarios. By integrating a novel emotion-neuroemotion taxonomy, a specialized lexicon, and semi-automated annotation (Cohen’s kappa = 0.85), the framework bridges linguistic patterns with neurobiological insights to support data-driven urban decision-making in urban planning and public policy. Evaluated across multiple machine learning pipelines, the sustainable emotion detection Smart Urban System leverages LightGBM with Neuroemotion-Informed BERT embedding to achieve 98.57% accuracy, 0.9855 F1 score, and 1.0 AUC, outperforming traditional representations like TF-IDF and Word2Vec. While BERT-based models require greater computational resources, their superior performance justifies their use in urban smart infrastructure for emotion-aware applications, striking a balance between precision and scalability. This work establishes a foundation for deploying Neuroemotion-aware emotion classifiers in smart urban systems, enhancing urban governance, public safety protocols, life cycle aware urban design, and adaptive city planning through contextually rich social media analysis. © 2025 International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology and Urban Development.","classification; emotion detection; framework; hinglish; smart system; sustainable emotion detection","classification; decision making; infrastructure; machine learning; public attitude; real time; smart city; social media; urban design; urban planning; urban policy","","","","","","","Tobin K., King D., Henderson S., Bellocchi A., Ritchie S.M., Expression of emotions and physiological changes during teaching, Cultural Studies of Science Education, 11, 3, pp. 669-692, (2016); Liu L., Hu S., Mehraliyev F., Zhou H., Yu Y., Yang L., Recognizing emotions in restaurant online reviews: A hybrid model integrating deep learning and a sentiment lexicon, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 36, 9, pp. 2955-2976, (2023); Calderon O., Oximetry: A reflective tool for the detection of physiological expression of emotions in a science education classroom, Cultural Studies of Science Education, 11, 3, pp. 653-667, (2016); Andalibi N., Buss J., The human in emotion recognition on social media: Attitudes, outcomes, risks, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems-Proceedings, (2020); Solanki A.A.S., Khan A.S.H., Achieving sustainable building design and construction system through nature-inspired built forms, International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology, 5, 1, pp. 50-59, (2022); Lewis M.D., Bridging emotion theory and neurobiology through dynamic systems modeling, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, (2005); Susman E., Inoff-Germain G., Nottelmann E.D., Loriaux D.L., Cutler G.B., Chrousos G.P., Hormones, emotional dispositions, and aggressive attributes in young adolescents, Child Development, (1987); Lumley M.A., Cohen J.L., Borszcz G.S., Cano A., Radcliffe A.M., Porter L.S., Schubiner H., Keefe F.

Residents’ satisfaction with the current urban environment is closely related to the landscape characteristics of the towns surrounding the historic center of Macau. This study aims to analyze the relationship between landscape characteristics and residents’ satisfaction, determine the key factors affecting their satisfaction and how they are combined, and provide a scientific basis for urban planning. This study used a decision tree machine learning model to analyze 524 questionnaire survey responses that addressed five aspects of the historic town’s landscape: the architectural, Largo Square, street, mountain and sea, and commercial landscapes. The data-driven approach helped find the best decision path. The results indicate that (1) the layout of Largo Square, the commercial colors and materials, the location of the former humanities and religion center, and the commercial signage system are the primary factors influencing residents’ satisfaction. (2) Incorporating decision tree parameters with information entropy as the splitting criterion and a minimum sample split number of two (with no maximum depth) led to the best performance when investigating residents’ satisfaction with Macau’s historic town landscape characteristics. (3) A reasonable layout for Largo Square (satisfaction > 3.50), prominent and harmonious commercial colors and materials (satisfaction > 3.50), rich cultural and religious elements (satisfaction > 4.50), and an excellent commercial signage system (satisfaction > 4.00) can significantly improve residents’ satisfaction. This provides important empirical support and a reference for urban planning and landscape design in Macau and other historical and cultural cities. © 2024 by the authors.","decision tree; historic built environment; historic urban landscape; machine learning; satisfaction questionnaire analysis; townscape characteristics; world heritage","Decision trees; Historic preservation; Urban planning; Built environment; Historic build environment; Historic centres; Historic urban landscape; Landscape characteristic; Machine-learning; Satisfaction questionnaire analyze; Townscape characteristic; Urban landscape; World heritage; Adversarial machine learning","","","","","","","Zandonai S.S., Amaro V., The Portuguese Calçada in Macau, Curr.

The objective was to provide insights beneficial for landscape design, urban planning, and the creation of more appealing and sustainable lake parks. To achieve this, two primary methods were employed in this study: the Automated Machine Learning (Auto ML) model and the DeepLab v3+ model. To gather data for the research, 46,444 images were collected from 20 different lake parks from 2019 to 2022. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Flickr, and specific lake park community groups were tapped to source photographs from both professional photographers and the general public. According to the experimental findings, the perceived frequency of natural landscapes was 69.27%, which was higher than that of humanistic landscapes by 30.73%. The perceived intensity was also maintained between 0.09 and 0.25. The perceived frequency of water body landscapes was much greater on a macro-scale, at 73.02%, and the public had various plant preferences throughout the year. Aquatic plant landscapes with low-to-medium green visibility were preferred by the public, according to the landscape share characterization, while amusement rides with medium-to-high openness were preferred. The sky visibility of amusement rides was between 0 and 0.1 and between 0.3 and 0.5, indicating that the public preferred amusement rides with medium-to-high openness. In lake parks, the populace chose settings with less obvious architectural features. When combined, the two models used in this study are useful for identifying and analyzing the intended traits and preferences of lake parks among the general public. They also have theoretical and practical application value for directing the development of lake parks and urban landscapes. © 2024 by the authors.","auto ML modeling; imagery features; lake parks; public perceived preferences","experimental study; image analysis; image classification; machine learning; park management; perception; public sector","","","","","Pukyong National University, PKNU","This work was supported by the Pukyong National University Research Fund in 2021.","Barma M., Modibbo U.M., Multiobjective mathematical optimization model for municipal solid waste management with economic analysis of reuse/recycling recovered waste materials, J.

In this study, we objectively measured the seemingly subjective qualities of the eye-level urban landscape perceptions with computer vision and machine learning technologies. We then explored correlations between the measured perceptual qualities and characteristics from the historical context. We chose Berlin as a research object because it is a capital city that owns a rich history of division and reunification, as well as a variety of residential zones built at different periods. We extracted 30 street features from the 150,000 Google Street View Imagery (SVI) dataset with a computer vision algorithm and evaluated eight perceptual qualities including typology, order, ecology, enclosure, aesthetics, richness, accessibility and scale with a machine learning method. Then we defined seven residential districts in Berlin, according to their spatial distributions and construction periods. Through a systematic comparison of perceptual qualities of the seven residential districts, we find perceptual qualities of ecology and enclosure have been improved a lot over a hundred years in Berlin. The housing policies and design codes in different social, economic and political contexts evolved to end overcrowding living conditions, create more open spaces, and develop a better ecological environment. This study enriches our understanding and application of subjective measures of human-centred built environment perception to the evolution of the historical urban landscape. The proposed quantitative framework of subjective human perception measures provides great testimony to evaluate the effects of the implementation of housing and other urban planning policies. Such an automated, multisource, high-throughput and scalable framework can be applied to other cities to determine the personality of the city and assess the impact of urban design and planning policies in streetscape improvement. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH ·.","Computer vision; Google street view image; Machine learning; Perceptual qualities","","","","","","","","Arnold J.D.M., Lafreniere D., Creating a longitudinal, data-driven 3D model of change over time in a postindustrial landscape using GIS and CityEngine, Journal of Cultural Heritage Management and Sustainable Development, 8, 4, pp. 434-447, (2018); The 'Hobrecht Plan' (1862) and Berlin's urban structure, Urban History, 31, 3, pp. 400-419, (2004); Bentlin F., Understanding the Hobrecht Plan.

This public infrastructure is deficient and lacks adequate equipment for the people who use, occupy, and transit within and around it, as well as for the numerous activities that occur, particularly at Carapungo’s Entry Park. Traditional methods for analyzing urban dynamics and land use are typically rigid and fail to grasp the complex and nonlinear nature of public spaces, especially in informal Global South cities. However, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, combined with aerial drone videos, have enabled the modeling and prediction of urban dynamics beyond state regulations and formal planning. In this context, we developed a model using Computer Vision Technology and the YOLOv5 algorithm, incorporating Deep Learning training. The objective is twofold: firstly, to detect people, their movement and speed; and secondly, to produce “Occupancy” and “Count & Speed” cartographies that highlight commuters’ spatial patterns. These situated cartographies provide valuable insights into urban design, mobility, and interaction within a conflicted public space’s-built environment. The generated data offer planners and policymakers quantitative spatial information to consider local practices and dynamics in urban planning, particularly in situations of informality and insufficient urban infrastructure. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence; image detection; public space; unmanned aerial vehicles; urban occupation; YOLOv5","Ecuador; Pichincha; Quito; aerial photograph; artificial intelligence; cartography; commuting; detection method; image analysis; prediction; public space; spatial analysis; state role; unmanned vehicle; urban planning","","","","","Universidad de Las Américas Ecuador, UDLA, (ARQ.AMG.20.02); Universidad de Las Américas Ecuador, UDLA","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Universidad de Las Americas, Quito, Ecuador; ARQ.AMG.20.02.","Alahi A., Bierlaire M., Vandergheynst P., Robust real-time pedestrians detection in urban environments with low-resolution cameras, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 39, pp. 113-128, (2014); Alavi H.S., Churchill E.F., Wiberg M., Et al., Introduction to human-building interaction (HBI), ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 26, 2, pp. 1-10, (2019); Aurenhammer F., Klein R., Voronoi Diagrams**partially supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft, grant K1 655 2-2, Handbook of Computational Geometry, pp. 201-290, (2000); Badrinarayanan V., Kendall A., Cipolla R., SegNet: a deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); Bramich D.M., A new algorithm for difference image analysis, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters, 386, 1, pp. L77-L81, (2008); Butila E.V., Boboc R.G., Urban traffic monitoring and analysis using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs): a systematic literature review, Remote Sensing, 14, 3, (2022); Craye C., Ardjoune S., Spatio-temporal semantic segmentation for drone detection, pp. 1-5, (2019); Dirección Metropolitana de Políticas y Planeamiento de la MovilidadPub.

This paper contrasts the impact of these factors individually, such as the immigrant rate and neighborhood segregation. To achieve this, a machine learning analysis was conducted on a sample of neighborhoods in the main Spanish metropolitan areas (Madrid and Barcelona), using a database created from a combination of official statistical sources and textual sources, such as Wikipedia. These texts were transformed into indexes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other artificial intelligence algorithms capable of interpreting images and converting them into indexes. The results indicate that the factors influencing immigrant concentration and segregation differ significantly, with crucial roles played by the urban landscape, population size, and geographic origin. While land prices showed a relationship with immigrant concentration, their effect on segregation was mediated by factors such as overcrowding, social support networks, and landscape degradation.

Given the resource-intensive nature of gathering evaluations on urban attractiveness through surveys or inquiries from residents, there is a constant quest for automated solutions to streamline this process and support spatial planning. In this study, we applied an off-the-shelf AI model to automate the analysis of urban attractiveness, using over 1800 Google Street View images of Helsinki, Finland. By incorporating the GPT-4 model, we assessed these images through three criteria-based prompts. Simultaneously, 24 participants, categorised into residents and non-residents, were asked to rate the images. To gain insights into the non-transparent decision-making processes of GPT-4, we employed semantic segmentation to explore how the model uses different image features. Our results demonstrated a strong alignment between GPT-4 and participant ratings, although geographic disparities were noted. Specifically, GPT-4 showed a preference for suburban areas with significant greenery, contrasting with participants who found these areas less attractive. Conversely, in the city centre and densely populated urban regions of Helsinki, GPT-4 assigned lower attractiveness scores than participant ratings. The semantic segmentation analysis revealed that GPT-4's ratings were primarily influenced by physical features like vegetation, buildings, and sidewalk. While there was general agreement between AI and human assessments across various locations, GPT-4 struggled to incorporate contextual nuances into its ratings, unlike participants, who considered both context and features of the urban environment. The study suggests that leveraging AI models like GPT-4 allows spatial planners to gather insights into the attractiveness of different areas efficiently. However, caution is necessary, while we used an off-the-shelf model, it is crucial to develop models specifically trained to understand the local context. Although AI models provide valuable insights, human perspectives are essential for a comprehensive understanding of urban attractiveness. © 2024","AI-human comparison; Multimodal large language models; Spatial planning; Street view imagery; Urban design","Finland; Helsinki; Varsinais-Suomi; Decision making; Geological surveys; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Urban planning; AI-human comparison; Helsinki; Language model; Multi-modal; Multimodal large language model; Semantic segmentation; Spatial planning; Street view imagery; Urban design; Urban environments; artificial intelligence; comparative study; imagery; software; spatial planning; urban design; urban region","","","","","European Research Council Executive Agency; Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture's Pilot for Doctoral Programmes; Helsingin Yliopisto, HY; European Commission, EC; European Research Council, ERC, (101044906); European Research Council, ERC","Funding text 1: This study is part of the GREENTRAVEL project (2023-2027) funded by the European Union (ERC, project 101044906).

The study investigates how AI-driven urban planning tools can be applied to create more sustainable, efficient, and functional urban environments. PM2.5 and PM10 show high concentrations with peaks between 2014 and 2017, indicating simple pollution actions. Post-2017, there is a noticeable decline in pollution levels, possibly due to improved regulations or the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific years, like 2016, show extreme spikes, possibly due to industrial activities or natural events. The overall trend suggests improved air quality and moderate to strong positive correlations exist between PM2.5 and PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO, indicating shared bases or co-occurrence. However, there is no significant correlation between PM2.5 and O3, suggesting different bases and behaviors. Bi-directional causality is observed between PM2.5 and PM10, PM2.5 and O3, PM2.5 and NO2, PM2.5 and SO2, and PM2.5 and CO. This mutual cause suggests interrelated impressive processes and shared bases. The results of the causality analysis suggest the existence of complex interactions, where high levels of pollution can predict changes in others. AI in urban design play vital role for identifying the most effective strategies for reducing pollution and helping to build more sustainable and functional urban environments in China. © 2024 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Carbon emission; Time series analysis; Urban areas; Wuhan","","","","","","","","Quan S.J., Park J., Economou A., Lee S., Artificial intelligence-aided design: smart Design for sustainable city development, Environ.

In previous studies in this context statistical methods such as variance analysis and regression analysis are the most used techniques, and these suffer from the limitations of large sample sizes and rigorous statistical assumptions. However, the rough sets approach, as a nonparametric method of artificial intelligence, can handle this problem. In this study, twenty civil-engineering students and twenty noncivil-engineering students took part in an image preference survey assessing photographs of sidewalks. Then the rough sets approach was conducted by a four-step procedure to analyze the survey results. Finally, the output of the rough sets approach is used to express people's perception of good and bad features of sidewalk space. The results will hopefully help planners to make effective decisions about sidewalk features. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.","","artificial intelligence; pedestrian; perception; public space; urban design","","","","","","","Baaijens S., Nijkamp P., Time pioneers and travel behaviour: An investigation into the viability of 'slow motion, Growth and Change, 30, pp. 237-263, (1999); Duntsch I., Gediga G., Uncertainty measures of rough set prediction, Artificial Intelligence, 106, pp. 109-137, (1998); Egmond P.V., Nijkamp P., Vindigni G., A comparative analysis of the performance of urban public transport systems in Europe, International Social Science Journal, 55, 176, pp. 235-247, (2003); Ergin A., Karaesmen E., Micallef A., Williams A.T., A new methodology for evaluating coastal scenery: Fuzzy logic systems, Area, 36, pp. 367-386, (2004); Florida R., The Rise of the Creative Class: And How it's Transforming Work, Leisure, Community and Everyday Life, (2002); Frank L.D., Stone B., Bachman W., Linking land use with household vehicle emissions in the Central Puger Sound: Methodological framework and findings, Transportation Research D, 5, 3, pp. 173-196, (2000); Frank L.D., Engelke P.O., Schmid T.L., Health and Community Design: The Impact of the Built Environment on Physical Activity, (2003); Fukahori K., Kubota Y., The role of design elements on the cost-effectiveness of streetscape improvement, Landscape and Urban Planning, 63, 2, pp. 75-91, (2003); Greco S., Matarazzo B., Slowinski R., A new rough set approach to evaluation of bankruptcy risk, Operational Tools In The Management of Financial Risks, pp. 121-136, (1998); Jeong S., Proposed policy guidelines for implementing pedestrian priority zone in Seoul, Research Reports, (2002); Li S.P., Will B.F., A fuzzy logic system for visual evaluation, Environment and Planning B: Planing and Design, 32, pp. 293-304, (2005); Lin T.Y., Crcone N., Rough Sets and Data Mining: Analysis for Imprecise Data, (1997); Medda F., Nijkamp P., A combinatorial assessment for complex transport policy analysis, Integrated Assessment, 4, 3, pp. 214-222, (2003); Muderrisoglu H., Eroglu E., Ozkan S., Ak K., Visual perception of tree forms, Building and Environment, 41, pp. 796-806, (2006); Nasar J.L., Hong X., Visual preferences in urban signscapes, Environment and Behavior, 31, pp. 671-691, (1999); Nijkamp P., Rietveld P., Spierdijk L., A meta-analytic comparison of determinants of public transport use: Methodology and application, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 27, pp. 893-903, (2000); Pawlak Z., Rough sets, International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences, 11, pp. 341-356, (1982); Pawlak Z., Rough set approach to knowledge-based decision support, European Journal of Operational Research, 99, pp. 48-57, (1991); Pawlak Z., Rough Sets: Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning about Data, (1997); Pawlak Z., Skowron A., Rough sets: Some extensions, Information Sciences, 177, pp. 28-40, (2007); Predki B., Slowinski R., Stefanowski J., Susmaga R., Wilk S., ROSE - software implementation of the rough set theory, Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing 1998, LNAI 1412, pp. 605-608; Saito A., Munemoto J., Matsushita D., Study on inference of combination rules of form elements by sensibility evaluation employing rough sets theory - a case of Sanneizaka preservation district for groups of historic buildings, Journal of Architecture and Planning, 594, pp. 85-91, (2005); Schroeder H.W., Cannon W.N., Visual quality of residential streets: Both street and yard trees make a difference, Journal of Arboriculture, 13, 10, pp. 236-239, (1987); Slowinski R., Zopoundis C., Application of the rough set approach to evaluation of bankruptcy risk, International Journal of Intelligence Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 4, pp. 27-41, (1995); Slowinski R., Greco S., Matarazzo S., Rough set based decision support, Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support, pp. 475-527, (2005); Sriram R.D., Artificial intelligence in engineering: Personal reflections, Advanced Engineering Informatics, 20, pp. 3-5, (2006); Todorova A., Asakawa S., Aikoh T., Preferences for and attitudes towards street flowers and trees in Sapporo, Japan, Landscape and Urban Planning, 69, pp. 403-416, (2004); Walczak B., Masart D.L., Rough sets theory, Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 47, pp. 1-16, (1999); Walter A.I., Scholz R.W., Critical success conditions of collaborative methods: A comparative evaluation of transport planning projects, Transportation, 34, pp. 195-212, (2007); Williams K., Exploring resident preferences for street trees in Melbourne, Australia Journal of Arboriculture, 28, 4, pp. 161-169, (2002); Wu C., Yue Y., Li M., Adjei O., The rough set theory and applications, Engineering Computations, 21, pp. 488-511, (2004)","M.

This study examines the impact of urban street landscape color characteristics on visitors’ emotional perceptions, providing insights for landscape planning. Focusing on Xi'an's inner-third ring road area, we use Full Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to create an visitors’ emotional perception dataset of street images. Machine learning techniques are employed to extract color features, construct quantitative color indexes, and visualize them spatially. Key findings include: (1) A spatial pattern where perceptions of beautiful and lively increase and depressing decreases from city centers, suggesting similarities between visitors' and residents' emotional responses; (2) A complex, non-linear relationship between color features and emotional perception, with optimal responses at color complexity 0.86 and coordination 0.84; (3) More pronounced color characteristics positively affect visitor emotions under non-routine conditions. Theoretically, this study confirms that vibrant environments enhance visitor experiences. Methodologically, it extends tourism studies by integrating streetscape big data and machine learning, moving beyond traditional text-based analysis. The results offer city managers valuable insights into visual preferences for streetscapes, aiding in the optimization of urban landscape design. © The Author(s) 2025.","Color features; Emotional perception; Fully Convolutional Networks; Machine learning; Random Forests; Streetscape images","Adversarial machine learning; Color vision; Decision trees; Machine learning; Random forests; Color characteristics; Color features; Convolutional networks; Emotional experiences; Emotional perception; Fully convolutional network; Machine-learning; Random forests; Streetscape image; Urban tourisms; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42071169, 42471265, 42271468); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant numbers 42071169, 42471265 and 42271468, and Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province, grant number.2019ZDLSF07-04.

For many, these tools are especially helpful in wading through, distilling, and prioritizing the large economic, social, and environmental datasets that are available for urban sites and for revealing proposals not typically considered in non-generative urban design processes. Some think that generative tools have the power to shift the funda-mental role of the urban designer but at the same time, there are concerns about the potential loss of designer agency. This study is based on the premise that it is necessary to critically evaluate emerging tools like those employed in generative design before they are widely adopted into mainstream practice. Thus, with this work, we studied the role of one generative tool – Spacemaker1 – to better understand the potential challenges and benefits of integrating these techniques into design workflows. We found that, in its current form, this tool cannot replace the detailed work of designers but can, instead, assist them to think outside of the box and with mundane, repetitive tasks. Furthermore, we found promise in a more hybridized future with a co-created design process. © 2024, VDE VERLAG GMBH.

A Dynamic Spatial Decision Support System was constructed to help identify the complex values characterizing a selected area in Naples' marginal urban landscape. The System consists of a set of selected indicators that represent the area's distinguishing characteristics with specific focus on its critical and potential factors. The formulation of spatial indicators helps identify the ecological, socio-economic and urban characteristics of the case-study area, along with their historic evolution over a specific time period. Time History Analysis (THA) enables the identification of permanent elements and transformations along with the relationships among the various urban landscape components over time. The synergistic interaction between the appropriately structured Geographic Information System (GIS) and the multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method help to generate a complex values map of the analyzed landscape to support the definition and location of strategic actions.

While recent studies have explored the phenomenon of urban sprawl, most of these studies have been limited to the mere identification of urban sprawl without offering comprehensive urban nonlinear factors for effectively curbing urban sprawl. Hence, the study seeks to identify various urban factors influencing urban sprawl and to propose targeted strategies for mitigation. The study’s timeframe encompasses the years 2010–2019 based on three cities with typical spatial structures and sprawl characteristics: Washington, DC, Chicago, and New York. In the initial phase, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the built environment and the socioeconomic factors in these cities to fully understand their spatial characteristics. Subsequently, by calculating the urban sprawl index (USI), we unveiled both consistencies and differences in sprawl patterns across these three cities. Then, with employing a random forest model, we quantitatively explored the nonlinear relationships between these factors and the USI, effectively identifying key influencing factors and proposing targeted measures. Our research results identified that the important factors influencing sprawl patterns include the socioeconomic factors such as income distribution and employment arrangements, as well as built environment factors such as road networks. These findings provide scientific support and decision-making reinforcement for urban planning and development, promoting the optimization of urban configurations, curbing the trend of urban sprawl, and advancing sustainable urban development. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Built environment; Machine learning; Socioeconomics; Sustainable urban development; Urban sprawl","District of Columbia; United States; Washington [District of Columbia]; Built environment; Machine-learning; Nonlinear factors; Socio-economic factor; Socio-economics; Spatial structure; Sustainable urban development; Urban construction; Urban sprawl; Washington; machine learning; nonlinearity; socioeconomic status; urban design; urban development; urban sprawl; Sustainable city","","","","","","","Abdullah J., City competitiveness and urban sprawl: Their implications to socio-economic and cultural life in Malaysian cities, Procedia Social Behav.

Existing studies mostly focus on single dimensions (e.g., vegetation ratio), lacking a large-scale integrated analysis of urban color and visual elements. To address this gap, this study employs semantic segmentation and color computation on a massive street-view image dataset encompassing 56 cities worldwide, comparing eight machine learning models in predicting Visual Aesthetic Perception Scores (VAPSs). The results indicate that LightGBM achieves the best overall performance. To unpack this “black-box” prediction, we adopt an interpretable ensemble approach by combining LightGBM with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAPs). SHAP assigns each feature a quantitative contribution to the model’s output, enabling transparent, post hoc explanations of how individual color metrics and visual elements drive VAPS. Our findings suggest that the vegetation ratio contributes the most to VAPS, but once greening surpasses a certain threshold, a “saturation effect” emerges and can no longer continuously enhance visual appeal. Excessive Sky Visibility Ratio can reduce VAPS. Moderate road visibility may increase spatial layering and vibrancy, whereas overly dense building significantly degrades overall aesthetic quality. While keeping the dominant color focused, moderate color saturation and complexity can increase the attractiveness of street views more effectively than overly uniform color schemes. Our research not only offers a comprehensve quantitative basis for urban visual aesthetics, but also underscores the importance of balancing color composition and visual elements, offering practical recommendations for public space planning, design, and color configuration. © 2025 by the authors.","machine learning; Place Pulse 2.0; street-view visual elements; urban aesthetics; urban color","color; ensemble forecasting; machine learning; urban design; urban development; urban renewal; visual analysis","","","","","Shanghai Intelligent Science and Technology IV Summit Discipline Cross-Innovation Science and Education Integration Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (524B2110); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC","This study is financed by The Project Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China No. 524B2110 and Shanghai Intelligent Science and Technology IV Summit Discipline Cross-Innovation Science and Education Integration Fund.","Chen Z., Qiao R., Li S., Zhou S., Zhang X., Wu Z., Wu T., Heat and Mobility: Machine Learning Perspectives on Bike-Sharing Resilience in Shanghai, Transp.

The perceived element for older adults' involvement in the environment differs from the average person. Despite this difference, there is little to no research into understanding how the perceived elements (specifically, the visuospatial configuration) of the environment influence older adults' involvement—most studies focused on younger adults. The focus here is stress, which occurs when environmental demand exceeds a person's capability. As stress impacts a person's involvement in the environment and older adults are more likely to feel stress due to their decline in functional capability, it is important to understand how the visuospatial configuration of urban environment influence stress. Older adults were recruited to participate in an urban environment walk while their physiological responses (Photoplethysmogram) were monitored using wearable sensors. Their perceived stress responses were also collected. Spatial clustering and hot spot analysis were conducted to detect locations with clusters of physiological responses caused by spatial factors. These locations were subsequently labelled as stress or non-stress based on participants' perceived stress. The perceived visual elements of the urban environment were extracted using isovist analysis. Principal component analysis, self-organising map and machine learning algorithms were used to understand the relationship. The results demonstrate that isovist minimum visibility, occlusivity, and isovist area are the most influential determinants of older adults' physiological stress. Older adults prefer urban configurations where they can be seen. This study can be used to inform urban design and planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Isovist analysis; Machine learning; Older adult; Person-environment interaction; Physiological stress; Self-organising map","Data mining; Learning algorithms; Physiological models; Physiology; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Urban planning; Wearable technology; Environment influence; Isovist analysis; Isovists; Older adults; Person-environment interaction; Physiological response; Physiological stress; Population aging; Stress sensing; Urban environments; data mining; elderly population; machine learning; perception; physiological response; urban area; Machine learning","","","","","Department of Building and Real Estate; Institute of Active Ageing; Maxwell Fordjour Antwi-Afari; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (PF17-02405); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong through the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme [reference number PF17-02405]; and the Department of Building and Real Estate, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. ; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge the Institute of Active Ageing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, in particular, Prof. Daniel W.L.

Existing research has established significant correlations between the built environment and mental health. This research, however, has relied on traditional statistical methods that are not amenable to working with large remote sensing image-based datasets. This research addresses this challenge and contributes new knowledge and a novel method for using generative deep learning for urban analysis and synthesis tasks involving mental health. The research specifically investigates three mental state measures: depression, anxiety, and the perception of safety. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the process—providing a new method to find correlational signals, while providing insights on the correlation between specific urban design features and the incidence of depression. © The Author(s) 2022.","depression; generative adversarial network; generative deep learning; urban planning","Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Health; Large dataset; Morphology; Remote sensing; Built environment; Depression; Disease burdens; Generative deep learning; Health disorders; Image-based; Mental health; Novel methods; Remote sensing images; Urban morphology; Urban planning","","","","","College of Architecture at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; University of Nebraska","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by funding from the College of Architecture at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
