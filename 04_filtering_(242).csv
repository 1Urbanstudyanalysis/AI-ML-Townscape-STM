This study examines the impact of urban street landscape color characteristics on visitors’ emotional perceptions, providing insights for landscape planning. Focusing on Xi'an's inner-third ring road area, we use Full Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to create an visitors’ emotional perception dataset of street images. Machine learning techniques are employed to extract color features, construct quantitative color indexes, and visualize them spatially. Key findings include: (1) A spatial pattern where perceptions of beautiful and lively increase and depressing decreases from city centers, suggesting similarities between visitors' and residents' emotional responses; (2) A complex, non-linear relationship between color features and emotional perception, with optimal responses at color complexity 0.86 and coordination 0.84; (3) More pronounced color characteristics positively affect visitor emotions under non-routine conditions. Theoretically, this study confirms that vibrant environments enhance visitor experiences. Methodologically, it extends tourism studies by integrating streetscape big data and machine learning, moving beyond traditional text-based analysis. The results offer city managers valuable insights into visual preferences for streetscapes, aiding in the optimization of urban landscape design. © The Author(s) 2025.",Color features; Emotional perception; Fully Convolutional Networks; Machine learning; Random Forests; Streetscape images,Adversarial machine learning; Color vision; Decision trees; Machine learning; Random forests; Color characteristics; Color features; Convolutional networks; Emotional experiences; Emotional perception; Fully convolutional network; Machine-learning; Streetscape image; Urban tourisms; Convolutional neural networks,,,,,"Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42071169, 42471265, 42271468); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant numbers 42071169, 42471265 and 42271468, and Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province, grant number.2019ZDLSF07-04.","Barnes, Stuart J., In living color?

While urban planning and design are known to influence road safety, it is not clear how features of the built environment contribute to traffic fatalities. In this study, we analyze road fatality data from 106 cities across six continents via a combination of computer vision and unsupervised clustering on 26.8 million Google Street View images. We use deep learning tools to extract 25 features from the images. Among these features, 19 are relatively static built environment features, and 6 are dynamic usage-related features (such as pedestrians, cars, buses, and bikes). On the basis of the built environment features, we group the urban streetscapes into six distinct visual clusters. We then examine how these clusters are related to city-level road fatality rates when various control variables (e.g., population size, carbon emissions, income, road length, road safety policy, and continent) and dynamic features are combined. Our findings show that cities with Open Arterials streetscape (extensive road surface, open-sky views, and railings) tend to have higher road fatality rates. After accounting for differences in the built environment, cities with better public transit (proxied by buses detected) tend to have fewer traffic deaths—specifically, a 1% increase in bus presence is linked to a 0.35% decrease in fatalities per 100,000 people. This study demonstrates the power of using widely available street view imagery to uncover global disparities in urban design and their connection to road safety. © 2025 The Authors",Built environment; Image analysis; Road safety; Streetscape; Urban design; Urban visual clusters,Buses; Deep learning; Highway accidents; Highway planning; Mass transportation; Motor transportation; Pedestrian safety; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Built environment; Fatality rates; Global cities; Image analyze; Image-analysis; Road safety; Road transports; Streetscape; Urban design; Urban visual cluster; Image analysis,,,,,-17616221,This research is funded by the Research Grant Council General Research Fund (No. 17616221) and is an initiative of the HKU Joint Laboratory on Future Cities.,"Almasi, Seyed Ahmadreza, Pedestrian Crash Exposure Analysis Using Alternative Geographically Weighted Regression Models, Journal of Advanced Transportation, 2021, (2021); Ahmed, Ishtiaque, Road traffic accident characteristics in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Jurnal Teknologi, 71, 3, pp. 75-82, (2014); Ali, Yasir, A Bayesian generalised extreme value model to estimate real-time pedestrian crash risks at signalised intersections using artificial intelligence-based video analytics, Analytic Methods in Accident Research, 38, (2023); Alnawmasi, Nawaf, The impact of higher speed limits on the frequency and severity of freeway crashes: Accounting for temporal shifts and unobserved heterogeneity, Analytic Methods in Accident Research, 34, (2022); Ameratunga, Shanthi N., Road-traffic injuries: confronting disparities to address a global-health problem, The Lancet, 367, 9521, pp. 1533-1540, (2006); Amin-Naseri, Mostafa, Evaluating the Reliability, Coverage, and Added Value of Crowdsourced Traffic Incident Reports from Waze, Transportation Research Record, 2672, 43, pp. 34-43, (2018); Atlas of Urban Expansion, (2012); Barrington-Leigh, Christopher P., Global trends toward urban street-network sprawl, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117, 4, pp. 1941-1950, (2020); Batomen, Brice, Traffic-Calming Measures and Road Traffic Collisions and Injuries: A Spatiotemporal Analysis, American Journal of Epidemiology, 193, 5, pp. 707-717, (2024); Beaverstock, Jonathan V., A roster of world cities, Cities, 16, 6, pp. 445-458, (1999)","B.P.Y.

However, most previous studies have concentrated on the macro-level aspects of the built environment, such as land-use mix, while overlooking the street-space quality characteristics that influence cyclists’ on-site perceptions. Although research has explored the role of objective visual features, studies on the audiovisual environment of streets and its perceived impact remain scarce. This study combines street view imagery, Strava Heatmap data, and interpretable machine learning to investigate the nonlinear and interactive effects of street-level spatial quality on cycling volumes. The results indicate that (1) auditory characteristics—especially noise intensity and sound quality—exert a significant and often stronger influence on cycling volume than visual features alone, challenging visual-centric planning assumptions; (2) several spatial features show nonlinear or threshold effects (e.g., green view index and soundscape eventfulness exhibit inverted U-shaped curves), indicating that excessive environmental richness may reduce cycling appeal (3) synergistic and antagonistic interactions exist between visual and auditory elements—for instance, natural sounds can mitigate the negative impact of high noise, while enclosed visual environments amplify it. These findings provide empirical evidence that optimizing—rather than maximizing—street-level sensory stimuli is essential for promoting active travel. Building on this insight, our study offers practical guidance for policymakers and urban designers to implement more targeted and context-sensitive interventions, and underscores the potential of integrating audiovisual design into sustainable transport planning. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Cycling volume; Machine learning; Spatial quality; Street view images,Acoustic intensity; Acoustic noise; Audiovisual; Image quality; Land use; Machine learning; Sound reproduction; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Built environment; Cycling behavior; Cycling volume; Machine-learning; Nonlinear effect; Quality characteristic; Spatial quality; Street view image; Transport environment; Visual feature; Learning systems; acoustics; cycle transport; imagery; machine learning; noise; nonlinearity; policy making; spatial analysis; threshold; transportation planning; urban design,,,,,"China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202306120267, 202108050061); China Scholarship Council, CSC",This research was funded by the China Scholarship Council (No. 202306120267 and No. 202108050061).,"undefined; Aletta, Francesco, Influence of personal factors on sound perception and overall experience in urban green areas.

Traditional methods for evaluating urban environmental quality have largely overlooked dynamic perceptual changes occurring throughout the day, resulting in incomplete assessments. To bridge this methodological gap, this study presents an innovative approach combining advanced deep learning techniques with time-series street view imagery (SVI) analysis to systematically quantify spatio-temporal variations in the perceived environmental quality of pedestrian-oriented streets. It further addresses two central questions: how perceived environmental quality varies spatially across sections of a pedestrian-oriented street and how these perceptions fluctuate temporally throughout the day. Utilizing Golden Street, a representative living street in Shanghai’s Changning District, as the empirical setting, street view images were manually collected at 96 sampling points across multiple time intervals within a single day. The collected images underwent semantic segmentation using the DeepLabv3+ model, and emotional scores were quantified through the validated MIT Place Pulse 2.0 dataset across six subjective indicators: “Safe,” “Lively,” “Wealthy,” “Beautiful,” “Depressing,” and “Boring.” Spatial and temporal patterns of these indicators were subsequently analyzed to elucidate their relationships with environmental attributes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating deep learning models with time-series SVI for assessing urban environmental perceptions, providing robust empirical insights for urban planners and policymakers. The results emphasize the necessity of context-sensitive, temporally adaptive urban design strategies to enhance urban livability and psychological well-being, ultimately contributing to more vibrant, secure, and sustainable pedestrian-oriented urban environments. © 2025 by the authors.",pedestrian-oriented streets; perceptual analysis; street environmental quality; time-series street view imagery; urban design,environmental quality; image analysis; image resolution; pedestrian; perception; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; time series; urban area; urban design; urbanization; China; Shanghai,,,,,"Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (21YJC760031); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE",This work is supported by the Youth Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education in China under Grant 21YJC760031.,"Schneider, Annemarie, Mapping global urban areas using MODIS 500-m data: New methods and datasets based on 'urban ecoregions, Remote Sensing of Environment, 114, 8, pp. 1733-1746, (2010); Lu, Yi, The effect of street-level greenery on walking behavior: Evidence from Hong Kong, Social Science and Medicine, 208, pp. 41-49, (2018); Saelens, Brian E., Built environment correlates of walking: A review, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 40, 7 SUPPL.1, pp. S550-S566, (2008); Mutual Interaction of People and their Built Environment, (1976); Streets as Public Spaces and Drivers of Urban Prosperity, (2013); Wang, Nan, Morphodynamic modeling of Fourleague Bay in Mississippi River Delta: Sediment fluxes across river-estuary-wetland boundaries, Coastal Engineering, 186, (2023); Liu, Lun, A machine learning-based method for the large-scale evaluation of the qualities of the urban environment, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 65, pp. 113-125, (2017); Biljecki, Filip, Street view imagery in urban analytics and GIS: A review, Landscape and Urban Planning, 215, (2021); Jeon, Junehyung, Deep learning analysis of street panorama images to evaluate the streetscape walkability of neighborhoods for subsidized families in Seoul, Korea, Landscape and Urban Planning, 230, (2023); Huang, Zhonghua, Assessment and determinants of residential satisfaction with public housing in Hangzhou, China, Habitat International, 47, pp. 218-230, (2015)","Y.

Values can be predicted more accurately by statistical or advanced methods together when the size of the data is huge. In metropolitan cities like İstanbul, where size of the real estate data is vast and complex, mass appraisal methods supported by Machine Learning offer a scalable and consistent alternative. This study employs six algorithms: Artificial Neural Network, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Semi-Log Regression, to estimate the values of real estate on both the Asian and European continent parts of İstanbul. In total, 168,099 residential properties were utilized along with 30 of their features from both sides of the Bosphorus. The results show that RF yielded the best performance in Beşiktaş, while XGBoost performed best in Üsküdar. ANN also produced competitive results, although slightly less accurate than those of XGBoost and RF. In contrast, traditional SVR and SLR models underperformed, especially in terms of R2 and RMSE values.

The pace of change in our societies is accelerated by climate change and the rapid introduction of artificial intelligence and other technologies. When presented with practical challenges or problems to solve that are inherently due to an ageing society, it is not possible for any individual to have the expertise and capacity to address all the dimensions involved. Therefore, developing a multidisciplinary framework that signals the dimensions of influence that need to be considered in adaptive ageing, may assist in optimizing how complex issues in ageing are tackled. This paper proposes a holistic adaptive ageing framework (HAAF) as a starting point for multidisciplinary and multisectoral approaches to develop optimal solutions to complex problems. The five dimensions of the framework include lived experience, person-level adaptation, environmental context, technology and social and economic policy.

Yet the perceptual implications of three‐dimensional (3D) form remain underexplored. In this study, we combine ResNet50‐based semantic segmentation of street‐view imagery with an XGBoost regression framework interpreted via SHAP values to quantify how 3D landscape morphology shapes residents’ perceptions of vitality, security, and aesthetics. Our model achieves R2 values above 0.85 for all perceptual dimensions, substantially outperforming analogous 2D‐only approaches. We find that urban vibrancy is maximized when total 3D volume (All_3DArea) falls between 1.0 and 3.0 × 10⁶ m3, patch density (PD_All_3D) ranges from 5.0 × 10−5 to 2.0 × 10−4, and vertical relief (RMSofHeight) remains under 10 m. Security perception peaks in human‐scaled contexts (All_3DArea < 5.0 × 105), at very low or very high fragmentation (PD_All_3D < 5.0 × 10−5 or > 2.5 × 10−4), and with moderate summit clustering (Dsummit ≈ 0.005–0.01) and gentle curvature (SummitCur < 1.0). Aesthetic appeal corresponds most strongly to landmark elevations (TenptHeight ≈ 350–400 and near 500), subtle interface complexity (S_dr < 0.05), intermediate fragmentation (PD_All_3D ≈ 1.0–1.2 × 10−4), and summit density (Dsummit ≈ 0.005–0.008). By uncovering these nonlinear “sweet spots,” our findings provide precise, human‐centered guidelines for 3D urban design—informing form‐based regulations, mixed‐use zoning, and topographic modulation to foster cohesive, vibrant, and beautiful cityscapes. © 2025 The Author(s)",3D urban landscape; GIS; Landscape perception; Livable cities; Machine learning,Maps; Regression analysis; Three dimensional computer graphics; Urban growth; Landscape perceptions; Livable city; Machine-learning; Perceptual dimensions; Residents' perceptions; Semantic segmentation; Sustainable cities; Three‐dimensional urban landscape; Urban landscape; Urban population; Mapping; GIS; landscape change; machine learning; perception; regression analysis; resident population; satellite imagery; segmentation; semantic standardization; urban area; urban population; urbanization,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72274025); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",This work has been supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (72274025).,"Ahern, Jack F., Urban landscape sustainability and resilience: The promise and challenges of integrating ecology with urban planning and design, Landscape Ecology, 28, 6, pp. 1203-1212, (2013); Bai, Yujia, 3D compact form as the key role in the cooling effect of greenspace landscape pattern, Ecological Indicators, 160, (2024); Ban, Jin, Evaluation of the factors influencing the housing safety awareness of residents in Shanghai, PLOS ONE, 15, 1, (2020); Biophilic Cities Integrating Nature into Urban Design and Planning, (2011); Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, (1973); Bian, Hongyan, China’s safe and just space during 40 years of rapid urbanization and changing policies, Landscape Ecology, 39, 4, (2024); Bibri, Simon Elias, Compact urbanism and the synergic potential of its integration with data-driven smart urbanism : An extensive interdisciplinary literature review, Land Use Policy, 97, (2020); Cha, Seung Hyun, Spatial perception of ceiling height and type variation in immersive virtual environments, Building and Environment, 163, (2019); Chen, Wenqi, Exploring the paradox of densification and greening in China’ s old cities, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 100, (2024); Chen, Yinan, A study on street walkability for older adults with different mobility abilities combining street view image recognition and deep learning - The case of Chengxianjie Community in Nanjing (China), Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 112, (2024)","J.

The built environment profoundly influences individuals' thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, underscoring the importance of understanding how people perceive their surroundings in relation to objectively measured urban form. Despite growing recognition of the role of perception in shaping urban experience, empirical assessments of the alignment between perceived and actual built environments remain limited. This study explores the relationship between subjective (human-perceived) and objective (measured) characteristics of the built environment through a pilot study conducted in the Melbourne metropolitan area. Using street-level imagery from the Mapillary platform and deep learning techniques, we quantify perceived built environment characteristics across the “5D” urban design dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Distance to transit, and Destination accessibility. These perceptions are then compared to objective spatial metrics to assess their alignment. Our analysis reveals that neighborhoods featuring compact urban form, high density, mixed land use, convenient service access, and abundant green space tend to be perceived as more livable and aesthetically appealing. However, this relationship weakens when density surpasses a threshold, leading to perceptions of overcrowding and reduced neighbourhood quality. The findings offer actionable, place-based evidence for urban planners and policymakers seeking to integrate human perceptions into planning frameworks. Additionally, the study's scalable methodology provides a foundation for developing a national database of perceived built environments in Australia, supporting broader applications in health, social equity, and environmental research. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental psychology; Human perceived built environment; Objective built environment; Street view image; Subjective built environment; Urban planning,Ecodesign; Energy conservation; Environmental management; Green development; Sustainable city; Australia; Built environment; Environmental psychology; Human perceived build environment; Objective build environment; Street view image; Subjective build environment; Urban form; Urban planning; database; machine learning; neighborhood; overcrowding; policy making; psychology; United Nations; urban design; urban planning; adult; aged; article; benchmarking; built environment; city planning; data base; deep learning; emotion; environmental psychology; female; groups by age; human; imagery; land use; metropolitan area; pilot study; social equity; sustainable development goal; city; perception; Built Environment; Cities; City Planning; Humans; Perception; Pilot Projects,,,,,,,"Population, (2023); undefined, (2021); undefined, (2021); Environmental Psychology, (2001); Biljecki, Filip, Street view imagery in urban analytics and GIS: A review, Landscape and Urban Planning, 215, (2021); Bin, Junchi, Multi-source urban data fusion for property value assessment: A case study in Philadelphia, Neurocomputing, 404, pp. 70-83, (2020); Land Use Data, (2023); undefined, (2022); undefined, (2017); undefined, (2017)","S.

While traditional survey data are time-consuming and could result in poor samples, data available via the Internet provides a new way to identify socioeconomic conditions and spatial functions in a city. However, existing methods often face limitations: approaches using only remote imagery or POI (Point of Interest) data fail to capture nuanced socioeconomic features, while social sensing data alone lacks morphological context. To address these challenges, this study presents a data-driven framework integrating POI data and census information, analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (K-Means), to recognize patterns of different socioeconomic levels and functional zones in Lisbon city. Using census data, four distinct types of socioeconomic zones were identified and classified based on specific demographic and economic characteristics. Additionally, the temporal analysis of POI data revealed varying functionalities across zones of different socioeconomic levels, with distinct activity patterns observed at different times of the day and the week. Zones of higher socioeconomic levels exhibited more recreational activity during weekends, while lower socioeconomic areas predominantly supported business-related services. By providing a comprehensive view of the interconnection between socioeconomic levels and functional dynamics, this study offers actionable insights into Lisbon's urban structure. Furthermore, the scalable framework demonstrates significant potential for application in other urban contexts, with implications for urban planning, resource allocation, and social equity. © 2025 The Authors",Functional zoning; K-means clustering; Land use; Socioeconomic characterization; Spatial data analysis; Urban planning,algorithm; cluster analysis; data management; land use; socioeconomic status; spatial data; urban planning; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal,,,,,"European Social Fund Plus, ESF; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/00326/2025, UIDP/00326/2025, PRT/BD/154266/2022); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the doctoral Grant PRT/BD/154266/2022 financed by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), and with funds from the State Budget, European Social Fund (ESF), through the Regional Operational Program of the Center (Centro 2020), and under the MIT Portugal Program.; Funding text 2: This work is financed through national funds by FCT - Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnologia, I.P. , in the framework of the Project UIDB/00326/2025 and UIDP/00326/2025.; Funding text 3: This work is financed through national funds by FCT - Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnologia, I.P., in the framework of the Project UIDB/00326/2025 and UIDP/00326/2025., This research was supported by the doctoral Grant PRT/BD/154266/2022 financed by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), and with funds from the State Budget, European Social Fund (ESF), through the Regional Operational Program of the Center (Centro 2020), and under the MIT Portugal Program.","Alho, André Romano, Analyzing the relation between land-use/urban freight operations and the need for dedicated infrastructure/enforcement - Application to the city of Lisbon, Research in Transportation Business and Management, 11, pp. 85-97, (2014); undefined; American Psychology Association; Computer Science Mathematics, (2004); Measuring Socioeconomic Status Ses in the Ncvs Background Options and Recommendations, (2014); Cao, Su, Functional Classification of Urban Parks Based on Urban Functional Zone and Crowd-Sourced Geographical Data, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 10, 12, (2021); undefined, (2024); Cocola-Gant, Agustín, Holiday rentals: The new gentrification battlefront, Sociological Research Online, 21, 3, (2016); Darin-Mattsson, Alexander, Different indicators of socioeconomic status and their relative importance as determinants of health in old age, International Journal for Equity in Health, 16, 1, (2017); undefined, (2020)","C.

Data collected from a field survey involving 24 public open spaces in Hong Kong, including perceptual responses from 1,882 participants and physical measurements, formed the basis of the analysis. The prediction model was constructed using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, as it outperformed the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and significantly exceeded the performance of traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) models in handling datasets with high contextual complexity. To circumvent the shortcomings of non-transparency and non-interpretable in machine-learning models, this study incorporated SHAP analysis to identify the most influential factors for open space soundscape and to investigate their interactions, which has not been revealed in earlier soundscape research. LAeq, perceived dominance of road traffic noise, greenery percentage and PET, were identified as the most influential factors. LAeq and perceived dominance of road traffic noise had significant negative effects, especially when LAeq exceeded 68 dBA. Greenery percentage showed a threshold effect, with dominant and positive contributions only when coverage exceeded 40 %. Notably, PET and its interaction with LAeq had a significant impact, with high temperatures (> 35 °C) intensifying the negative impacts of high sound pressure levels. These findings underscore the importance of “sound-visual-thermal” interactions and highlight that urban design should minimize the coexistence of high sound pressure levels, elevated temperatures, and heightened road traffic noise perceptions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Machine learning; Multisensory; Nonlinearity; SHAP analysis; Soundscape,Acoustic field measurement; Acoustic noise measurement; Linear regression; Traffic surveys; Influential factors; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Multisensory; Nonlinearity; Public open spaces; Road traffic noise; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation analyze; Soundscapes; Acoustic intensity measurement; game theory; machine learning; noise; nonlinearity; open space; perception; public space; road traffic; urban design; China; Hong Kong,,,,,,,"Salih, Sarah Abdulkareem, Criteria for Public Open Space Enhancement to Achieve Social Interaction: A Review Paper, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 291, 1, (2018); Lestan, Katarina Ana, The role of open space in urban neighbourhoods for health-related lifestyle, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 11, 6, pp. 6547-6570, (2014); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2016); undefined; Sudarsono, Anugrah Sabdono, The effect of sound level on perception of reproduced soundscapes, Applied Acoustics, 110, pp. 53-60, (2016); Genuit, Klaus, Psychoacoustics and its benefit for the soundscape approach, Acta Acustica United with Acustica, 92, 6, pp. 952-958, (2006); Liu, Jiang, Landscape effects on soundscape experience in city parks, Science of the Total Environment, 454-455, pp. 474-481, (2013); Pijanowski, Bryan Christopher, Soundscape ecology: The science of sound in the landscape, BioScience, 61, 3, pp. 203-216, (2011); Lionello, Matteo, A systematic review of prediction models for the experience of urban soundscapes, Applied Acoustics, 170, (2020); Annual Review of Psychology, (1973)","H.C.

By converting pixels into Cubixels, we can analyze the image’s 3D properties, thereby enriching image processing and computer vision tasks. Utilizing Cubixels, we’ve developed algorithms for advanced image segmentation, edge detection, texture analysis, and feature extraction, yielding a deeper comprehension of image content. Our empirical experimental results on benchmark images and datasets showcase the applicability of these concepts. Further, we discuss future applications of Cubixels and VoV in various domains, particularly in medical imaging, where they have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic processes. By interpreting images as complex ‘urban landscapes’, we envision a new frontier for deep learning models that simulate and learn from diverse environmental conditions.

By integrating Baidu Street View images with deep learning-based object detection (Faster R-CNN), we quantify fine-grained human-powered and mechanically assisted mobility vitality. These features are fused with multi-source geospatial data encompassing 23 built environment variables into an interpretable machine learning pipeline using SHAP-optimized random forest models. The key findings reveal distinct nonlinear response patterns between HP and MA modes to built environment factors; for instance, a notable promotion in mechanically assisted NMT vitality is observed as enterprise density increases beyond 0.2 facilities per ha. Emergent synergistic and threshold effects are evident from variable interactions requiring multidimensional planning consideration, as demonstrated in phenomena such as the peaking of human-powered NMT vitality occurring at public facility densities of 0.2–0.8 facilities per ha, enterprise densities of 0.6–1 facilities per ha, and spatial heterogeneity patterns identified through Bivariate Local Moran’s I clustering.

While perceptions are shaped by the interplay of multiple visual elements, existing studies often isolate single semantic features, overlooking their combinations. This study proposes a Landscape Element Combination Extraction Method (SLECEM), which integrates the UniSal saliency detection model and semantic segmentation to identify landscape combinations that play a dominant role in human perceptions of streetscapes. Using street view images (SVIs) from the central area of Futian District, Shenzhen, China, we further construct a multi-dimensional feature–perception coupling analysis framework. The key findings are as follows: 1. Both low-level visual features (e.g., color, contrast, fractal dimension) and high-level semantic features (e.g., tree, sky, and building proportions) significantly influence streetscape perceptions, with strong nonlinear effects from the latter. 2. K-Means clustering of salient landscape element combinations reveals six distinct streetscape types and perception patterns. 3. Combinations of landscape features better reflect holistic human perception than single variables. 4. Tailored urban design strategies are proposed for different streetscape perception goals (e.g., beauty, safety, and liveliness). Overall, this study deepens the understanding of streetscape perception mechanisms and proposes a highly operational quantitative framework, offering systematic theoretical guidance and methodological tools to enhance the responsiveness and sustainability of urban streetscapes. © 2025 by the authors.",landscape element combination; SHAP interpretability analysis; street view image (SVI); streetscape perceptions; urban design strategies; XGBoost,landscape; machine learning; optimization; perception; sustainability; urban design; China; Futian; Guangdong; Shenzhen,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (52108059); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52108059).,"Xu, Jiayuan, Effects of urban living environments on mental health in adults, Nature Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 1456-1467, (2023); Place Branding and Public Diplomacy, (2008); Appleyard, Donald, The Environmental Quality of City Streets: The Residents’ Viewpoint, Journal of the American Planning Association, 38, 2, pp. 84-101, (1972); Cheng, Liang, Use of Tencent Street View imagery for visual perception of streets, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 6, 9, (2017); Callaghan, A., The impact of green spaces on mental health in urban settings: a scoping review, Journal of Mental Health, 30, 2, pp. 179-193, (2021); Batistatou, Adamantia, Virtual Reality to Evaluate the Impact of Colorful Interventions and Nature Elements on Spontaneous Walking, Gaze, and Emotion, Frontiers in Virtual Reality, 3, (2022); Zhang, Yonglin, The premium of public perceived greenery: A framework using multiscale gwr and deep learning, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 13, (2021); Zhang, Zhehao, Campus environmental quality and streetscape features related to walking activity, Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering, 23, 1, pp. 405-423, (2024); Dong, Lin, Assessing impacts of objective features and subjective perceptions of street environment on running amount: A case study of Boston, Landscape and Urban Planning, 235, (2023); He, Nan, Urban neighbourhood environment assessment based on street view image processing: A review of research trends, Environmental Challenges, 4, (2021)","J.

Considering the limitations of current garden design, which is inefficient and relies on human experience, this study proposes an intelligent generation framework based on a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). In constructing the CGAN model, we determine the spatial characteristics of the Suzhou Gardens and, combined with historical floor plan data, train the network. We then design an optimization strategy for the model training process and finally test and verify the generative space scheme. The research results indicate the following: (1) The CGAN model can effectively capture the key elements of the garden space and generate a planar scheme that conforms to the traditional space with an accuracy rate reaching 91.08%. (2) This model can be applied to projects ranging from 200 to 1000 square meters. The generated results can provide multiple scheme comparisons for update decisions, helping managers to efficiently select the optimal solution. (3) Decision-makers can conduct space utilization analyses and evaluations based on the generated results. In conclusion, this study can help decision-makers to efficiently generate and evaluate the feasibility of different design schemes, providing intelligent support for decision-making in urban renewal plans. © 2025 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; design decision-making; Jiangnan gardens; urban landscape renewal,Generative adversarial networks; Learning systems; Optimization; Personnel training; Urban planning; Adversarial networks; Case-studies; Decision makers; Design decision-making; Jiangnan garden; Machine-learning; Network models; Urban landscape; Urban landscape renewal; World cultural heritages; Decision making,,,,,"Macau University of Science and Technology, MUST, (FRG-25-041-FA); Macau University of Science and Technology, MUST","This research was supported by the Faculty Research Grants funded by Macau University of Science and Technology (grant number: FRG-25-041-FA).

However, traditional assessment methods, such as the green view index, primarily quantify green coverage while neglecting vegetation diversity, color richness, and seasonal dynamics, which are critical for urban livability. Objectives: This study develops a multi-temporal and multi-perspective analysis framework for urban green space visualization, introducing the Seasonal Species-Specific Plant View Index (S3PVI) to quantify plant coverage at the species level, capturing seasonal changes and visual diversity. Methods: The framework integrates computer vision, deep learning, and 3D reconstruction technologies, including structure from motion and 3D Gaussian splatting. To validate the S3PVI, case studies were conducted in Suita City, Japan, analyzing real-world seasonal vegetation patterns and testing the framework in a virtual park environment to assess its applicability in urban design. Results: The S3PVI effectively captured species-specific seasonal patterns, with cherry blossoms peaking at 45.61% visibility in spring and maples at 56.78% in autumn. Comparative analysis revealed distinctive vegetation strategies between streets, with Sanshikisaido showing higher seasonal amplitude but lower consistency than Nakayoshido. Virtual simulations confirmed that multi-species schemes optimally balanced seasonal impact with year-round visual stability. Conclusions: The S3PVI framework advances urban vegetation assessment by providing species-specific and seasonally dynamic visual data, supporting evidence-based urban planning for ecological sustainability and livability. Potential applications include brownfield redevelopment, virtual park planning, and urban design simulations. © The Author(s) 2025.",3D reconstruction; Multi-temporal analysis; Semantic segmentation; Street view imagery; Urban green space; Vegetation visualization,environmental quality; greenspace; reconstruction; satellite imagery; segmentation; semantic standardization; sustainability; temporal analysis; urban design; urban ecosystem; urban planning; vegetation dynamics; visualization; Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Osaka [Kinki]; Suita,,,,,,"Open Access funding provided by The University of Osaka.

However, there is a scarcity of understanding of nighttime safety despite the fast-growing body of urban scene auditing research based on daytime street view imagery (SVI). To fill the gap, this study collected ∼1000 pairwise day-and-night SVIs to train a day-to-night (D2N) SVI generator to effectively predict nighttime SVI based on daytime counterpart using generative adversarial network (GAN). The accuracy of fake nighttime image was evaluated with commonly-used GAN metrics (e.g., structural similarity index, inception score) and human validation. Then, an online visual survey with 46 participants was conducted to collect their perceived safety on street scenes during daytime and nighttime (D&N), and the results become training labels for machine learning models to predict D&N safety perceptions. Our results revealed significant discrepancies in D&N safety perception. First, through correlation analysis, we found that the sky and building features matter to the prediction accuracy of generated nighttime SVIs. Second, the micro-level streetscape features (e.g., pavements, roads, and buildings) play influential roles in perceived safety. Third, higher safety perceptions are consistently found in areas with higher building density regardless of whether they are daytime or night. In contrast, untended trees and grass reduce perceived safety at night. This study provides a valuable reference for improving the accuracy of generating nighttime images from daytime SVIs. It also reveals how streetscapes affect D&N safety perceptions in high-density cities like Hong Kong, providing empirical evidence for urban design policies to facilitate nighttime attractiveness and prosperity. © 2024 The Authors",Day-to-night translation; Hong Kong; Nighttime urban scene; Safety perception; Street view imagery (SVI),,,,,,"University of Hong Kong, HKU","This research is supported by the University of Hong Kong's URC Seed Fund for Basic Research for New Staff, and Start-up Fund from Faculty of Architecture (FOA) and the Department of Urban Planning and Design (DUPAD).

Designed to analyze tweets related to crises, conflicts, and tragedies, the system maps emotional states to neuroemotion processes, enabling emotion-aware urban analytics for real-time monitoring of public sentiment in high-stress scenarios. By integrating a novel emotion-neuroemotion taxonomy, a specialized lexicon, and semi-automated annotation (Cohen’s kappa = 0.85), the framework bridges linguistic patterns with neurobiological insights to support data-driven urban decision-making in urban planning and public policy. Evaluated across multiple machine learning pipelines, the sustainable emotion detection Smart Urban System leverages LightGBM with Neuroemotion-Informed BERT embedding to achieve 98.57% accuracy, 0.9855 F1 score, and 1.0 AUC, outperforming traditional representations like TF-IDF and Word2Vec. While BERT-based models require greater computational resources, their superior performance justifies their use in urban smart infrastructure for emotion-aware applications, striking a balance between precision and scalability.

To effectively utilize AI-generative design results for spatial vitality creation and evaluation, exploring whether generated spaces respond to people’s emotional demands is necessary. This study establishes a comparative framework analyzing emotional attachment characteristics between LoRA-generated spatial designs and the real urban vitality space, using the representative case of THE BOX in Chaoyang, Beijing. Empirical data were collected through structured on-site surveys with 115 validated participants, enabling a comprehensive emotional attachment evaluation. SPSS 26.0 was employed for multi-dimensional analyses, encompassing aggregate attachment intensity, dimensional differentiation, and correlation mapping. Key findings reveal that while both generative and original spatial representations elicit measurable positive responses, AI-generated designs demonstrate a limited capacity to replicate the authentic three-dimensional experiential qualities inherent to physical environments, particularly regarding structural articulation and material tactility. Furthermore, significant deficiencies persist in the generative design’s cultural semiotic expression and visual-interactive spatial legibility, resulting in diminished user satisfaction. The analysis reveals that LoRA-generated spatial solutions require strategic enhancements in dynamic visual hierarchy, interactive integration, chromatic optimization, and material fidelity to bridge this experiential gap. These insights suggest viable pathways for integrating generative AI methodologies with conventional urban design practices, potentially enabling more sophisticated hybrid approaches that synergize digital innovation with built environment realities to cultivate enriched multisensory spatial experiences. © 2025 by the authors.",AI-generative design; emotional attachment scales; emotional design; LoRA technology; urban vitality space,artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; research; urban design; urban planning; Chaoyang; China; Liaoning,,,,,"Beijing Forestry University, BJFU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (52208005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF; Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation, (22GLC063, 230805329162932); Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation","Funding text 1: We would like to thank to all the people including onsite users and online participants for supporting our research.

Tehran, a metropolis under mounting water stress, exemplifies this global crisis. With population pressures, migration, poor urban planning, and inadequate environmental management intensifying the demand for water, reliance on groundwater surged to over 51 % of the city's total supply by 2021. This unsustainable dependence is compounded by severe aquifer depletion, now declining at an alarming rate of 32 cm annually. This study adopts advanced machine learning approaches to provide a forward-looking, integrative approach to understanding and mitigating the impacts of urban centralization, land-use mismanagement, and climate variability on Tehran's water resources. By leveraging hybrid simulation models, combining Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models with three optimization techniques (i.e. Fire Hawk Optimizer (FHO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Horse Optimization Algorithm (HOA)) this research offers a powerful tool for managing water allocation across five critical dam reservoirs and the Tehran aquifer. Our analysis reveals that the RNN-FHO model demonstrates superior performance in predicting dam inflows, while the RNN-WOA model excels in forecasting groundwater table fluctuations, providing a vital roadmap for water resource planners. We developed a robust conceptual model to address anticipated drinking water shortages by supplementing surface water with groundwater resources. To simulate future conditions, we employed three state-of-the-art climate models (MRI-ESM2, CNRM-CM6-1, and BCC-CSM2) across three emission pathways (SSP1.26, SSP2.45, and SSP5.85) for the period 2021–2050. The projections indicate a troubling trend: dam inflows could decline by 8% in the most optimistic scenario and by 11 % in the worst case. Furthermore, by 2030, water demand in Tehran is expected to exceed 2.2 BCM, intensifying pressure on groundwater resources and necessitating large-scale water transfers. Excessive groundwater extraction, ranging from 100 to 300 MCM, would result in drastic aquifer drawdowns of 46–171 cm, threatening both hydrological stability and environmental health. This study highlights the critical need for a paradigm shift in water management practices. A strategic approach, encompassing reductions in per capita water consumption, extensive recycling, improved use of treated effluent in urban landscapes, and optimized water allocation, is essential to avert a looming water crisis. The methodologies and insights presented in this study offer transformative solutions for water-stressed urban environments worldwide. © 2025 The Authors",Adaptation strategy; Aquifer recharge; Climate change; Climate models; Water resource allocation; Water resource imbalance,"Estuaries; Global warming; Highway administration; Lakes; Recharging (underground waters); Resource allocation; Rivers; Runoff; Strategic planning; Adaptation strategies; Aquifer recharge; Neural-networks; Optimization algorithms; Optimizers; Water allocations; Water resource allocation; Water resource imbalance; Water shortages; Waters resources; Aquifers; drinking water; ground water; surface water; climate change; environmental management; machine learning; paradigm shift; recharge; water demand; water management; water resource; aquifer; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; centralization; city planning; climate model; conceptual model; controlled study; convolutional neural network; dam (barrier); deep learning; deep neural network; drought; effluent; environmental health; fire hawk algorithm; forecasting; groundwater depletion; horse optimization algorithm; land use; landscape; long short term memory network; machine learning algorithm; megalopolis; metropolitan area; prediction; recurrent neural network; recycling; resource allocation; simulation; sustainable development; urban area; urbanization; water supply; whale optimization algorithm; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Climate Change; Deep Learning; Drinking Water; Groundwater; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Resources; Water Supply",,Drinking Water,,,"University of Warwick; Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/S007350/1); Natural Environment Research Council, NERC",The authors acknowledge resources and support from the Scientific Computing Research Technology Platform (SCRTP) at the University of Warwick.

This notion encompasses concepts such as the 5-minute city, 10-minute city, 15-minute city, and 20-minute city. It has emerged as a novel approach in urban design and planning, focusing on sustainable, smart, and and climate-resilient cities characterized by proximity and efficient accessibility. Despite this growing interest, there is a lack of a literature review on this notion. This study employs bibliometric analysis techniques utilizing Bibliometrix and VOSviewer software tools to analyze bibliographic data, identify trending topics and terms, identify research gaps, and explore future research directions. The findings showed that interest in X-minute cities began with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and intensified as the pandemic affected urban communities worldwide. Results showed that topics such as accessibility, mobility, food, walkability, quality of life, and smart city have garnered relatively more attention. Separate analyses of articles related to X-minute cities, 15-minute cities, and 20-minute showed that the thematic focus of 15-minute and 20-minute cities is different. The most important clusters identified by co-occurrence analysis for X-minute cities, 15-minute cities, and 20-minute cities were urban planning and neighborhoods, mobility and accessibility, and socioeconomic aspects, respectively. Based on the findings, we identified nine future research directions that require further development. Among other things, future research should pay more attention to implementation challenges and topics related to energy, artificial intelligence, public preferences, health, and regulations. The results of this research contribute to the advancement and development of the notion of X-minute cities, enhancing its integration into both practice and theory. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Fifteen-minute cities; Proximity; Sustainable urbanism; Twenty-minute cities; Urban planning and design; X-minute cities,literature review; sustainability; urban area; urban design; urban planning,,,,,,,"15 Minute City Quantified Using Mobility Data, (2022); Abbiasov, Timur, The 15-minute city quantified using human mobility data, Nature Human Behaviour, 8, 3, pp. 445-455, (2024); Asian Journal of Research in Education and Social Sciences, (2023); Adibhesami, Mohammad Anvar, Effect of urban design on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mahabad, Iran, Cities and Health, (2024); Alberti, Francesco, From the Neighbourhood Unit to the 15-Minute City.

Existing studies mostly focus on single dimensions (e.g., vegetation ratio), lacking a large-scale integrated analysis of urban color and visual elements. To address this gap, this study employs semantic segmentation and color computation on a massive street-view image dataset encompassing 56 cities worldwide, comparing eight machine learning models in predicting Visual Aesthetic Perception Scores (VAPSs). The results indicate that LightGBM achieves the best overall performance. To unpack this “black-box” prediction, we adopt an interpretable ensemble approach by combining LightGBM with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAPs). SHAP assigns each feature a quantitative contribution to the model’s output, enabling transparent, post hoc explanations of how individual color metrics and visual elements drive VAPS. Our findings suggest that the vegetation ratio contributes the most to VAPS, but once greening surpasses a certain threshold, a “saturation effect” emerges and can no longer continuously enhance visual appeal. Excessive Sky Visibility Ratio can reduce VAPS. Moderate road visibility may increase spatial layering and vibrancy, whereas overly dense building significantly degrades overall aesthetic quality. While keeping the dominant color focused, moderate color saturation and complexity can increase the attractiveness of street views more effectively than overly uniform color schemes. Our research not only offers a comprehensve quantitative basis for urban visual aesthetics, but also underscores the importance of balancing color composition and visual elements, offering practical recommendations for public space planning, design, and color configuration. © 2025 by the authors.",machine learning; Place Pulse 2.0; street-view visual elements; urban aesthetics; urban color,color; ensemble forecasting; machine learning; urban design; urban development; urban renewal; visual analysis,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (524B2110); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC",This study is financed by The Project Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China No. 524B2110 and Shanghai Intelligent Science and Technology IV Summit Discipline Cross-Innovation Science and Education Integration Fund.,"Chen, Zeyin, Heat and mobility: Machine learning perspectives on bike-sharing resilience in Shanghai, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 142, (2025); Li, Xu, Urban Architectural Color Evaluation: A Cognitive Framework Combining Machine Learning and Human Perception, Buildings, 14, 12, (2024); Tosca, Theano Fannie, Environmental colour design for the third millennium: An evolutionary standpoint, Color Research and Application, 27, 6, pp. 441-454, (2002); Zhang, Chi, Quantifying architectural color Quality: A Machine learning integrated framework driven by quantitative color metrics, Ecological Indicators, 157, (2023); J Public Space, (2018); Tuijin Jishu J Propuls Technol, (2023); Jeong, Jin Su, The visual evaluation of rural areas: A methodological approach for the spatial planning and color design of scattered second homes with an example in Hervás, Western Spain, Land Use Policy, 46, pp. 330-340, (2015); Mehanna, Walaa Abou El Haggag, Urban renewal for traditional commercial streets at the historical centers of cities, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 58, 4, pp. 1127-1143, (2019); Bian, Wenjuan, Study on the Characteristics and the Causes of Urban Color Evolution Based on New Contextualism, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 189, 6, (2018); Park, Keunhyun, Street life and the built environment in an auto-oriented US region, Cities, 88, pp. 243-251, (2019)","Z.

While predictive models like deep learning and Markov models offer insights into individual mobility, they often struggle with out-of-routine behaviors. Our study introduces an approach that dynamically integrates individual and collective mobility behaviors, leveraging collective intelligence to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluating the model on millions of privacy-preserving trajectories across five US cities, we demonstrate its superior performance in predicting out-of-routine mobility, surpassing even advanced deep learning methods. The spatial analysis highlights the model’s effectiveness near urban areas with a high density of points of interest, where collective behaviors strongly influence mobility. During disruptive events like the COVID-19 pandemic, our model retains predictive capabilities, unlike individual-based models. By bridging the gap between individual and collective behaviors, our approach offers transparent and accurate predictions, which are crucial for addressing contemporary mobility challenges. © © 2025 the Author(s).",collective behavior; generalization; GPS Data; human mobility,"accuracy; Article; behavior; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; human; intelligence; predictive model; spatial analysis; city; epidemiology; pandemic; population dynamics; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; theoretical model; United States; Cities; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Population Dynamics; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,"European Commission, EC; (IR0000013, 3264 on 28/12/2021, CN00000013); (CUP B53D23012770006, 20224CZ5X4_PE6_PRIN 2022); (101120237); (PE00000013)","Funding text 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

T<inf>mrt</inf> is heavily influenced by urban morphology, including building layout, street design, and green spaces which alter airflow, shading, and heat retention. Evaluating geometry alternatives during the early design stages in urban neighborhoods is challenging due to lengthy simulations and the need for extensive expertise in physical models. Recent studies have employed data-driven methods for quick design comparisons and new urban layout evaluations, successfully predicting Thermal indicators of Urban heat Island phenomenon but often limited by the diversity of urban configurations inputs used in training datasets. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel framework that uses machine learning models to predict T<inf>mrt</inf> as the primary indicator. A comprehensive training dataset of 200 cases was generated in Rhino7 using Grasshopper, Ladybug, and Dragonfly plugins. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of input uncertainties on model predictions, and the model's performance was validated against unseen configurations. Among six machine learning algorithms tested, the CatBoost Regressor achieved the highest accuracy, predicting T<inf>mrt</inf> with an R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 4.30 °C, and MAE = 2.34 °C. Validation using 20 additional cases showed an accuracy of R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 3.34 °C, and MAE = 2.27 °C in predicting T<inf>mrt</inf> heat maps for new urban configurations. This framework successfully enables real-time T<inf>mrt</inf> heat map analysis in simplified cubic neighborhoods within a 3D environment. Additionally, it enhances the temporal and spatial resolution of thermal patterns predictions, offering rapid and detailed insights into various urban design alternatives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Catboost Regressor; Data-Driven Methods; Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt); Urban Design; Urban Environmental Comfort,Sensitivity analysis; Catboost regressor; Data-driven methods; Environmental comfort; Mean radiant temperature; Thermal; Urban configurations; Urban design; Urban environmental comfort; Urban heat island; Thermal modeling,,,,,,,"Shashua-Bar, Limor, Vegetation as a climatic component in the design of an urban street.

This study employs advanced techniques, including satellite imagery analysis and Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-Markov) modelling, to forecast urban expansion in Tehran, Iran, up to the year 2035. While the study is geographically focused on Tehran, the methodologies and insights can be adapted to other rapidly urbanizing regions facing similar challenges. Leveraging satellite imagery (2000–2023), the research delineates Tehran’s historical urban growth and projects future land use change. The study uses supervised machine learning algorithms for classification and CA-Markov modeling to simulate future urban dynamics. The study generates a simulated map for 2035, offering insights into the potential spatial distribution of built-up areas, bare land, water bodies, and vegetation. The findings reveal significant urban expansion, driven by population growth, economic development, and infrastructure expansion. The built-up area is projected to grow significantly due to rapid urbanization, while bare land and vegetation cover will decrease, highlighting the environmental pressures of urban expansion. The study also observes minor effects on water bodies, reflecting the subtle impact of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems. This analysis enhances the understanding of the socio-economic, policy, and environmental factors shaping Tehran’s urban landscape. It offers valuable insights for developing sustainable development strategies and provides a model for assessing urban growth dynamics, contributing to global urban sustainability discussions and offering tools for urban planners worldwide. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Cellular automata Markov chain; Land cover; Random forest; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Tehran; Urban growth,algorithm; aquatic ecosystem; cellular automaton; economic development; infrastructure planning; land cover; land use change; machine learning; population growth; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sustainable development; urban growth; urbanization; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)],,,,,,,"Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Data Science, (2020); Al-Sharif, Abubakr A.A., Urban Sprawl Analysis of Tripoli Metropolitan City (Libya) Using Remote Sensing Data and Multivariate Logistic Regression Model, Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing, 42, 1, pp. 149-163, (2014); Angel, Shlomo, The dimensions of global urban expansion: Estimates and projections for all countries, 2000-2050, Progress in Planning, 75, 2, pp. 53-107, (2011); Atlas of Urban Expansion, (2012); Azabdaftari, Anali, Predicting urban tomorrow: CA-Markov modeling and district evolution, Earth Science Informatics, 17, 4, pp. 3215-3232, (2024); Barredo, Ji, Towards a set of IPCC SRES urban land use scenarios: Modelling urban land use in the Madrid region, Environmental Science and Engineering, 9783540684893, pp. 363-385, (2008); New Science of Cities, (2013); Batty, Michael J., From cells to cities, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 21, Celebration Issue, pp. 531-548, (1994); Batty, Michael J., Smart cities of the future, European Physical Journal: Special Topics, 214, 1, pp. 481-518, (2012); Benenson, Itzhak, Geosimulation: Automata-based Modeling of Urban Phenomena, pp. 1-287, (2006)","A.

This study aims to explore the optimization path of urban landscape design through the integration of thermodynamics and machine learning, with a particular focus on the integrated application of thermal energy cycle and ecological cycle. This study constructed an urban thermodynamic model based on thermodynamic laws, and clarified the distribution and cycling characteristics of thermal energy in urban ecosystems by defining urban thermodynamic entropy and conducting thermal radiation analysis. At the same time, machine learning technology was used for urban feature extraction, and semantic extraction and model performance analysis were conducted based on theoretical foundations to accurately identify the heat flow patterns in the city. This study proposes an optimization strategy for urban landscape design that integrates thermal and ecological cycles. By identifying urban ecological units and cycling patterns, combined with the specific characteristics of the city, design optimization schemes have been developed for different urban environments. These plans aim to enhance the comfort and ecological sustainability of urban thermal environments. Research has shown that by integrating thermodynamic models with machine learning techniques, the scientificity and adaptability of urban landscape design can be effectively improved, which can help alleviate the urban heat island effect, promote the restoration and development of the ecological environment, and provide new perspectives and practical paths for future urban planning. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Ecological cycle; Integrated application; Machine learning; Optimization research; Thermal energy cycle; Thermodynamic model; Urban landscape design,Ecological cycles; Energy cycle; Integrated applications; Landscape design; Machine-learning; Optimization researches; Thermal; Thermal energy cycle; Thermodynamic modelling; Urban landscape; Urban landscape design,,,,,(2023 J0709),This work was supported by Scientific Research Fund of Education Department of Yunnan Province: Study on Cold Island Effect of Park Green Space and Its Influencing Factors in Kunming (No.2023\u202FJ0709).,"Lai, Dayi, A review of mitigating strategies to improve the thermal environment and thermal comfort in urban outdoor spaces, Science of the Total Environment, 661, pp. 337-353, (2019); Mavromatidis, Lazaros Elias, Constructal macroscale thermodynamic model of spherical urban greenhouse form with double thermal envelope within heat currents, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 14, (2019); Jordan, Michael I., Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects, Science, 349, 6245, pp. 255-260, (2015); Donihue, Colin M., Adaptive evolution in urban ecosystems, Ambio, 44, 3, pp. 194-203, (2015); Sugar, Lorraine, Thermodynamics of urban growth revealed by city scaling, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 557, (2020); Aramendia, Julene, Spectroscopic speciation and thermodynamic modeling to explain the degradation of weathering steel surfaces in SO2 rich urban atmospheres, Microchemical Journal, 115, pp. 138-145, (2014); Semenyuk, Olga N., Integrated Urban Design, Civil Engineering and Architecture, 10, 4, pp. 1631-1640, (2022); Wang, Qingqing, Ecological circular agriculture: A case study evaluating biogas slurry applied to rice in two soils, Chemosphere, 301, (2022); Addison, Jane, Applying the social–ecological systems framework to the evaluation and design of payment for ecosystem service schemes in the Eurasian steppe, Biodiversity and Conservation, 25, 12, pp. 2421-2440, (2016); Chang, Yuan, Design of Rural Human Settlement Unit with the Integration of Production-Living-Ecology of China Based on Dynamic Emergy Analysis, Buildings, 13, 3, (2023)","L.

Given the resource-intensive nature of gathering evaluations on urban attractiveness through surveys or inquiries from residents, there is a constant quest for automated solutions to streamline this process and support spatial planning. In this study, we applied an off-the-shelf AI model to automate the analysis of urban attractiveness, using over 1800 Google Street View images of Helsinki, Finland. By incorporating the GPT-4 model, we assessed these images through three criteria-based prompts. Simultaneously, 24 participants, categorised into residents and non-residents, were asked to rate the images. To gain insights into the non-transparent decision-making processes of GPT-4, we employed semantic segmentation to explore how the model uses different image features. Our results demonstrated a strong alignment between GPT-4 and participant ratings, although geographic disparities were noted. Specifically, GPT-4 showed a preference for suburban areas with significant greenery, contrasting with participants who found these areas less attractive. Conversely, in the city centre and densely populated urban regions of Helsinki, GPT-4 assigned lower attractiveness scores than participant ratings. The semantic segmentation analysis revealed that GPT-4's ratings were primarily influenced by physical features like vegetation, buildings, and sidewalk. While there was general agreement between AI and human assessments across various locations, GPT-4 struggled to incorporate contextual nuances into its ratings, unlike participants, who considered both context and features of the urban environment. The study suggests that leveraging AI models like GPT-4 allows spatial planners to gather insights into the attractiveness of different areas efficiently. However, caution is necessary, while we used an off-the-shelf model, it is crucial to develop models specifically trained to understand the local context. Although AI models provide valuable insights, human perspectives are essential for a comprehensive understanding of urban attractiveness. © 2024",AI-human comparison; Multimodal large language models; Spatial planning; Street view imagery; Urban design,Decision making; Geological surveys; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Urban planning; AI-human comparison; Helsinki; Language model; Multi-modal; Multimodal large language model; Semantic segmentation; Spatial planning; Street view imagery; Urban design; Urban environments; artificial intelligence; comparative study; imagery; software; spatial planning; urban design; urban region; Finland; Varsinais-Suomi,,,,,"Helsingin Yliopisto, HY; European Commission, EC; European Research Council, ERC, (101044906); European Research Council, ERC","Funding text 1: This study is part of the GREENTRAVEL project (2023-2027) funded by the European Union (ERC, project 101044906).

Particularly, the recognition of urban thermal hotspots is crucial for adding effective cooling interventions for mitigation and avoiding overheating in newly built areas. However, the hotspots and associated drivers vary across time and space, bringing challenges to urban planners to make win-win decisions to synchronously address diurnal and nocturnal heat stresses through an integrated set of cooling strategies. This study aims to recognize the homogeneity and heterogeneity of diurnal and nocturnal hotspots and interpret principal and synergetic drivers behind them by developing a robust methodological scheme in addressing uncertainties associated with temperature data and analytical models. It explicitly 1) identified summer diurnal and nocturnal hotspots using rigorously screened satellite data; 2) recognized the typical typologies of hotspot-prone urban landscape according to urban composition, morphology, and function; 3) explored the day-night similarities and disparities in major urban factors and their robust effective ranges for synergetic mitigation through multi-model non-linear analysis with diverse machine learning techniques covering random forest, gradient boosting machines, and boosted regression trees. Results revealed that the specific locations and typical urban landscape features varied between diurnal and nocturnal hotspots. Among the six typologies recognized, industrial-dominated ones were more inclined to emerge as diurnal hotspots, while mid- to high-rise and mid-density blocks, with diversified land uses (mostly residential-dominated), tended to become diurnal, and more likely, nocturnal hotspots. All three models reached robust conclusion that urban morphology exhibited significant influence on both diurnal and nocturnal hotspot formation. Although trade-offs remained unavoidable in many cases, synergetic mitigation could be achieved through optimizing area averaged building height below 15 m or above 25 m, and building volume density under 2 % for Wuhan, China. Overall, this study responds to the emerging multidimensional urban science and praxis and extends the conventional one-dimensional planning against urban heat to win-win decisions over both diurnal and nocturnal hotspots. The empirical findings can benefit the development of complete, unbiased, and implementable actions for enhanced climate-resilience. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Climate-resilience; Co-benefits; Diurnal and nocturnal hotspots; Multi-model analysis; Synergetic mitigation; Urban surface thermal environment,Adaptive boosting; Urban planning; Climate-resilience; Cobenefits; Diurnal and nocturnal hotspot; Hotspots; Modeling analyzes; Multi-model analyze; Multi-modelling; Synergetic mitigation; Synergetics; Thermal environment; Urban surface thermal environment; Urban surfaces; Decision trees; air temperature; climate modeling; heat island; heterogeneity; homogeneity; urban planning; China; Hubei; Wuhan,,,,,"(LBXT2023YB04); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52078389, 52308079, 42301339); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; (20240302); (GHKF-202301); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (2023AFB080); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province; China Meteorological Administration, CMA, (CMA2024QN15); China Meteorological Administration, CMA","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52308079 , 42301339 , 52078389 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province ( 2023AFB080 ), Key Laboratory of Spatial Intelligent Planning Technology, Ministry of Natural Resources ( 20240302 ), Key Laboratory of Earth Surface System and Human-Earth Relations ( LBXT2023YB04 ), Tianjin Key Laboratory of Smart City Planning ( GHKF-202301 ), and the China Meteorological Administration \u201CResearch on value realization of climate ecological products\u201D Youth Innovation Team Project (No. CMA2024QN15 ).","Acuto, Michele, Building a global urban science, Nature Sustainability, 1, 1, pp. 2-4, (2018); Anselin, Luc E., GeoDa: An introduction to spatial data analysis, Geographical Analysis, 38, 1, pp. 5-22, (2006); Apley, Daniel W., Visualizing the effects of predictor variables in black box supervised learning models, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

This problem is important and topical and has many implications for decision-makers across multiple sectors, such as urban design, urban climate, agriculture, transportation, energy, and disaster management. This problem involves selecting a small subset of data (specific days) from the original large dataset (decades long), such that it captures the essential information and characteristics of the large dataset, while minimizing redundancy. This is useful as it makes the dataset more manageable for processing, analysis, and insight gathering without degrading the overall quality of the information content. We develop a novel algorithm that is based on advanced machine learning and optimization techniques and consists of two stages: (1) spatial dimensionality reduction (SDR) to reduce the number of spatial cells analyzed while preserving as much relevant information as possible and (2) representative subset selection (RSS) to find a small subset of days in the dataset that captures the essential patterns, relationships, and information present in the full dataset—these are the mesoscale weather patterns. We demonstrate our methodology by applying it to a spatio-temporal dataset of atmospheric observations, the ERA5 dataset, in Singapore. The MWPs offer valuable insights into the region’s diverse weather conditions and help researchers, climatologists, and policymakers comprehend the complex interactions between atmospheric elements. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Machine learning; Mesoscale weather patterns; Representative subset selection; Submodular functions,Adversarial machine learning; Dimensionality reduction; Information management; Urban transportation; Climate datasets; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Machine-learning; Meso scale; Mesoscale weather pattern; Representative subset selection; Submodular functions; Subset selection; Weather patterns; Decision making; data set; decision making; machine learning; mesoscale meteorology; optimization; weather forecasting; Singapore [Southeast Asia],,,,,"National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","The research was conducted under the Cooling Singapore project, funded by Singapore\u2019s National Research Foundation (NRF).","Piotrowicz, Katarzyna, A selection of weather type classification systems and examples of their application, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 140, 1-2, pp. 719-730, (2020); Krause, Andreas, Robust submodular observation selection, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 9, pp. 2761-2801, (2008); Lin, Hui, A class of submodular functions for document summarization, 1, pp. 510-520, (2011); Nevat, Ido, The Urban Heat Footprint (UHF)—a new unified climatic and statistical framework for urban warming, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 140, 1-2, pp. 359-374, (2020); Nevat, Ido, Urban Climate Risk Mitigation via Optimal Spatial Resource Allocation, Atmosphere, 13, 3, (2022); Nevat, Ido, Recommendation system for climate informed urban design under model uncertainty, Urban Climate, 31, (2020); Hersbach, Hans E., The ERA5 global reanalysis, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 146, 730, pp. 1999-2049, (2020); Era Report Series, (2009); Merra 2 File Specification, (2016); Ncep Climate Forecast System Reanalysis Cfsr 6 Hourly Products January 1979 to December 2010, (2010)","I.

While extensive research exists on rainfall magnitude forecasting, less attention has been given to predicting rainfall occurrences. This study addresses this gap by examining rainfall state prediction in four cities in India: Bhubaneshwar, Pune, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. Traditionally, the Markov Chain model has been used to simulate rainfall occurrences, but higher-order Markov models remain unexplored. Additionally, not many studies have utilized Machine Learning (ML) models for rainfall state prediction. This research compares Decision Tree-based Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) techniques with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order Markov Chains. Results indicate that Random Forest and XGBoost outperform Markov Chain models in predicting daily rainfall states. However, for rainfall statistics like wet days, dry spell duration, and rain event length, the stochastic Markov Chain model proves more effective.

This study aims to use advanced deep learning technology and generative adversarial networks to construct an efficient urban and rural landscape feature recognition model to achieve accurate analysis and classification of urban and rural landscape elements. This paper first introduces the basic principles of deep learning and generative adversarial networks and their application status in the field of urban and rural landscape feature processing and then elaborates on how to combine these two technologies to design a new urban and rural landscape feature recognition framework. The model is trained by a large number of multi-source data sets such as high-resolution satellite images and aerial photos, and successfully extracts key elements such as architectural style, green coverage, road layout, etc., and can accurately transform this information into intuitive visual expression, providing a scientific basis for subsequent urban planning. Experiments show that after training with 50,000 images, the proposed model has achieved satisfactory results: the accuracy rate of urban and rural landscape feature recognition reaches 93.2%, which is better than the current mainstream algorithms. This achievement not only helps to deepen our understanding of the spatial pattern of urban and rural areas but may also be widely used in cultural heritage protection, ecological environment monitoring, tourism development and other fields, which have important theoretical value and social significance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",Applied research; Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Model construction; Urban and rural landscape feature recognition,Adversarial networks; Applied research; Deep learning; Features recognition; Landscape feature; Model construction; Rural landscapes; Urban and rural; Urban and rural landscape feature recognition; Urban landscape; Generative adversarial networks; algorithm; cultural heritage; landscape ecology; rural area; rural landscape; satellite imagery; tourism development,,,,,,,"Allawi, Ahmed Hussein, A new approach towards the sustainability of urban-rural integration: The development strategy for central villages in the Abbasiya District of Iraq using GIS techniques, Regional Sustainability, 4, 1, pp. 28-43, (2023); Anríquez, G., Refining the scale of the rural-urban landscape: A policy-relevant application to Chile, Applied Geography, 168, (2024); Bobadilla, Jesús Bobadilla@upm Es, Wasserstein GAN-based architecture to generate collaborative filtering synthetic datasets, Applied Intelligence, 54, 3, pp. 2472-2490, (2024); Chandra, Rohitash, Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Multi-Step Ahead Time Series Prediction, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 83105-83123, (2021); Chew, Alvin Wei Ze, Large-scale 3D point-cloud semantic segmentation of urban and rural scenes using data volume decomposition coupled with pipeline parallelism, Automation in Construction, 133, (2022); Dietz, Katharina, Want More WANs?

However, existing building material databases are typically limited to individual projects or specific geographic areas, offering only approximate assessments. Acquiring large-scale and precise material data is hindered by inadequate records and financial constraints. Here, we introduce a novel automated framework that harnesses recent advances in sensing technology and deep learning to identify roof and facade materials using remote sensing data and Google Street View imagery. The model was initially trained and validated on Odense's comprehensive dataset and then extended to characterize building materials across Danish urban landscapes, including Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Our approach demonstrates the model's scalability and adaptability to different geographic contexts and architectural styles, providing high-resolution insights into material distribution across diverse building types and cities. These findings are pivotal for informing sustainable urban planning, revising building codes to lower carbon emissions, and optimizing retrofitting efforts to meet contemporary standards for energy efficiency and emission reductions. © 2025",Building material intensity; Built environment; Deep learning; Remote sensing; Streetview image,,,,,,"European Commission, EC, (101056810); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202107940001, 202006730004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71991484, 71991480)","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71991484, 71991480), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Peking University, the Independent Research Fund Denmark (iBuildGreen), the European Union under grant agreement No. 101056810 (CircEUlar), and the China Scholarship Council (202006730004 and 202107940001).","Zhong, Xiaoyang, Global greenhouse gas emissions from residential and commercial building materials and mitigation strategies to 2060, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Elhacham, Emily, Global human-made mass exceeds all living biomass, Nature, 588, 7838, pp. 442-444, (2020); Berrill, Peter, Decarbonization pathways for the residential sector in the United States, Nature Climate Change, 12, 8, pp. 712-718, (2022); Buildings, (2022); Davis, Steven J., Emissions rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, Nature Climate Change, 12, 5, pp. 412-414, (2022); Kikstra, Jarmo S., Climate mitigation scenarios with persistent COVID-19-related energy demand changes, Nature Energy, 6, 12, pp. 1114-1123, (2021); Pauliuk, Stefan, Global scenarios of resource and emission savings from material efficiency in residential buildings and cars, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Zhou, Nan, Scenarios of energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction potential in the buildings sector in China to year 2050, Nature Energy, 3, 11, pp. 978-984, (2018); Yu, Yifei, A systematic literature review on Circular Economy implementation in the construction industry: a policy-making perspective, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 183, (2022); Huang, Tao, Materials demand and environmental impact of buildings construction and demolition in China based on dynamic material flow analysis, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 72, pp. 91-101, (2013)","G.

The research team developed a preliminary method for using observational analysis and real-time object detection to study pedestrian engagement with public art. A custom machine-learning script was developed in Python based on open-source YOLOv3, an algorithm first described by Redmon et al. By building on Redmon et al.’s work, we increased the reliability and validity of our own custom script, which was tested on a range of walking conditions both at our site and using stock video footage of streets in other locales. Video recordings of pedestrian movements near sculptural artwork on Tufts campus captured by a low-tech security camera were run through the algorithm to generate path diagram images of passersby the artwork, enabling the research team to select videos where pedestrian behaviors of interest occur for empirical review. Research results evidence social walking behavior (groups of two or more) and proximity to walking path (adjacent to the sidewalk) are correlated with greater pedestrian engagement with artwork (looking at the art). These interdisciplinary methods successfully selected videos where pedestrians engaged with public artwork, verifying AI technologies are a promising research tool for studying walking behavior in a more data-driven way than has been done previously. Quantitative measures of pedestrian responses to public art can help urban planners and designers to promote art’s benefits including walkability, quality-of-life, and well-being. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",Public art; Walkability; YOLOv3,algorithm; art; artificial intelligence; image analysis; interdisciplinary approach; neighborhood; pedestrian; urban design; urban planning; visual analysis; walking,,,,,,"Funding for this research provided by the Data Intensive Study Center at Tufts University.

Understanding these decisions is essential for effective urban planning. While discrete choice models have been used to predict residential locations, their limitations in handling complex datasets have hindered their accuracy. Machine learning has shown potential to outperform discrete choice methods in transportation-related decisions like travel mode. However, the traditional application of these methods to residential location choice faces challenges due to the large number of choice alternatives and the limitations of sample size and data availability. This often leads to biased predictions, favoring popular choices over less common ones. This study introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations, making machine learning more effective for residential location choice. By applying this method and different machine learning models, the study provides a detailed comparison of their performance in predicting residential choices. A comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms reveals that XGBoost and gradient boosting models significantly outperform traditional methods, achieving a 42 % accuracy rate in predicting residential location choices on the 33 % validation data of household travel survey data from MWCOG. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to optimize land use, transportation, and urban development strategies. © 2025 The Author(s)",Extra tree; Gradient boosting; Machine learning; Random forest; Residential location choice; Stacking technique; Voting technique; XGBoost,Adversarial machine learning; Random forests; Urban transportation; Extra-trees; Gradient boosting; Location choice; Machine-learning; Residential location choice; Residential locations; Stacking technique; Stackings; Voting techniques; Xgboost; Contrastive Learning,,,,,,,"Abulibdeh, Ammar O., Analysis of mode choice affects from the introduction of Doha Metro using machine learning and statistical analysis, Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives, 20, (2023); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Transit-Oriented Development in Saudi Arabia: Riyadh as a Case Study, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 23, (2022); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Towards sustainable green mobility in the future of Saudi Arabia cities: Implication for reducing carbon emissions and increasing renewable energy capacity, Heliyon, 9, 3, (2023); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Traffic congestion patterns in the urban road network: (Dammam metropolitan area), Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 14, 3, (2023); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Investigating the New Public Transportation System in Riyadh City, Journal of the Urban Planning and Development Division, ASCE, 150, 1, (2024); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Smart transportation planning and its challenges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Sustainable Futures, 8, (2024); Banyong, Chinnakrit, A machine learning comparison of transportation mode changes from high-speed railway promotion in Thailand, Results in Engineering, 24, (2024); Transportation Research Procedia, (2017); Cantarella, G.

Traditional methods for investigating the urban thermal environment and corresponding human thermal comfort level are often resource intensive, inefficient, and limited in scope. To address these challenges, we (1) introduce a new concept named thermal affordance, which formalises the integrated inherent capacity of a streetscape to influence human thermal comfort based on its visual and physical features; and (2) an efficient method to evaluate it (visual assessment of thermal affordance — VATA), which combines street view imagery (SVI), online and in-field surveys, and statistical learning algorithms. VATA extracts five categories of image features from SVI data and establishes 19 visual-perceptual indicators for streetscape visual assessment. Using a multi-task neural network and elastic net regression, we model their chained relationship to predict and comprehend thermal affordance for Singapore. VATA predictions are validated with field-investigated OTC data, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and transferable method to assess the thermal comfort potential of urban streetscape. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by generating a geospatially explicit mapping of thermal affordance, outlining a model update workflow for long-term urban-scale analysis, and implementing a two-stage prediction and inference approach (IF-VPI-VATA) to guide future streetscape improvements.

While recent studies have explored the phenomenon of urban sprawl, most of these studies have been limited to the mere identification of urban sprawl without offering comprehensive urban nonlinear factors for effectively curbing urban sprawl. Hence, the study seeks to identify various urban factors influencing urban sprawl and to propose targeted strategies for mitigation. The study’s timeframe encompasses the years 2010–2019 based on three cities with typical spatial structures and sprawl characteristics: Washington, DC, Chicago, and New York. In the initial phase, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the built environment and the socioeconomic factors in these cities to fully understand their spatial characteristics. Subsequently, by calculating the urban sprawl index (USI), we unveiled both consistencies and differences in sprawl patterns across these three cities. Then, with employing a random forest model, we quantitatively explored the nonlinear relationships between these factors and the USI, effectively identifying key influencing factors and proposing targeted measures. Our research results identified that the important factors influencing sprawl patterns include the socioeconomic factors such as income distribution and employment arrangements, as well as built environment factors such as road networks. These findings provide scientific support and decision-making reinforcement for urban planning and development, promoting the optimization of urban configurations, curbing the trend of urban sprawl, and advancing sustainable urban development. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Built environment; Machine learning; Socioeconomics; Sustainable urban development; Urban sprawl,Built environment; Machine-learning; Nonlinear factors; Socio-economic factor; Socio-economics; Spatial structure; Sustainable urban development; Urban construction; Urban sprawl; Washington; Sustainable city; machine learning; nonlinearity; socioeconomic status; urban design; urban development; urban sprawl; District of Columbia; United States; Washington [District of Columbia],,,,,,,"Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2012); Abdul Somed, Arimiyaw, Rethinking the implications of sprawl to building sustainable secondary cities; case of Tamale, Ghana, Local Environment, 29, 6, pp. 806-822, (2024); Almatar, Khalid Mohammed, Drivers of urban sprawl in Dammam metropolitan area (DMA), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A qualitative exploration, Journal of Urban Management, 13, 3, pp. 469-481, (2024); Forum Geografi, (2018); Asibey, Michael Osei, Rethinking the implications of sprawl for sustainable urban development: Insights from the Ejisu Municipality of Ghana between 2003 and 2023, Habitat International, 152, (2024); Bosch, Martí, Addressing Urban Sprawl from the Complexity Sciences, Urban Science, 3, 2, (2019); Berkeley Undergraduate Journal, (2011); Brueckner, Jan K., Urban sprawl: Diagnosis and remedies, International Regional Science Review, 23, 2, pp. 160-171, (2000); Bueno-Suárez, Carlos, Sustaining what is unsustainable: A review of urban sprawl and urban socio-environmental policies in North America and Western Europe, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 11, (2020); Journal of Agriculture Food Systems and Community Development, (2013)","X.

A hybrid approach enables stakeholders to actively define their city’s future by simulating several re-design scenarios utilizing AI data management. This interactive representation of possible results enables well-informed decision-making, where the advantages and limitations are carefully considered, guaranteeing that the re-design aligns with the requirements and needs of the local communities. This integrative method promotes openness and a feeling of responsibility, establishing the basis for resilient urban environments that emerge from conflict. METHODS: The study establishes a foundation for using Artificial Intelligence technologies to solve complex urban development challenges by critically examining existing approaches for urban re-design after the war and promoting interventions powered by Artificial Intelligence-driven processes. This study aims to contribute to the field of post-war rebuilding of urban landscapes by developing a solution that can be generalized. This study adopts a qualitative methodology approach to investigate the possible integration of Artificial Intelligence in re-designing urban landscapes post-war. The methodology is structured to examine existing approaches and studies of post-war urban recovery, compare traditional and AI-assisted approaches, and propose a hybrid approach that combines both. The study structure is a literature review and theoretical approach development, data collection, and analysis, depending on multiple sources, including government reports and academic research, as well as hybrid approach development. FINDINGS: The discussion provides theoretical evidence of the potential advances in this empirical approach, highlighting the efficiency improvements achievable by using Artificial Intelligence technologies in a hybrid phased approach that integrates traditional post-war processes with Artificial Intelligence-assisted ones. The study also highlights the importance of ethical considerations in Artificial Intelligence restoration procedures, addressing acceptance, community involvement, and cultural heritage safeguarding concerns. This emphasis on ethics reassures the audience about Artificial Intelligence’s responsible and conscientious use in post-war re-design. CONCLUSION: The study explores the potential integration of Artificial Intelligence in re-designing postwar urban landscapes. It compares conventional methods of urban revival with innovative Artificial Intelligence-supported methods to determine the advantages of utilizing Artificial Intelligence in post-war urban re-design. Traditional techniques for gathering data, allocating resources, and engaging the community have many challenges that negatively affect the effectiveness of re-designing and re-design measures. This study suggests that integrating Artificial Intelligence with traditional strategies can help overcome these challenges by analyzing extensive datasets, which leads to effective decision-making. A hybrid approach combining conventional and Artificial Intelligence-supported methods is suggested to improve the resiliency and sustainability of the re-designing process. It aims to enhance resource distribution and strategic planning through Artificial Intelligence-assisted strategies. ©2025 The author(s).",AI-assisted design approach; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Conventional design approach; Data management; Post-war redesign,,,,,,,"This study was done while the authors were faculty members.

This public infrastructure is deficient and lacks adequate equipment for the people who use, occupy, and transit within and around it, as well as for the numerous activities that occur, particularly at Carapungo’s Entry Park. Traditional methods for analyzing urban dynamics and land use are typically rigid and fail to grasp the complex and nonlinear nature of public spaces, especially in informal Global South cities. However, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, combined with aerial drone videos, have enabled the modeling and prediction of urban dynamics beyond state regulations and formal planning. In this context, we developed a model using Computer Vision Technology and the YOLOv5 algorithm, incorporating Deep Learning training. The objective is twofold: firstly, to detect people, their movement and speed; and secondly, to produce “Occupancy” and “Count & Speed” cartographies that highlight commuters’ spatial patterns. These situated cartographies provide valuable insights into urban design, mobility, and interaction within a conflicted public space’s-built environment.

Several studies have confirmed that campus public spaces contain multiple restorative potentials. Yet, the campus public space is still not ready to meet students’ new need for restorative percetions. Renewal practices for campus public spaces that integrate multi-issues are becoming more important, and further clarification of the measurement methods and optimization pathways is also needed. This study applied the semantic segmentation technique of the deep learning model to extract the feature indicators of outdoor public space based on street view image (SVI) data. The subjective evaluation of small-scale SVIs was obtained using the perceived restorative scale-11 (PRS-11) questionnaire. On this basis, restorative benefit evaluation models were established, including the explanatory and predictive models. The explanatory model used Pearson’s correlation and multiple linear regression analysis to identify the key indicators affecting restorative benefits, and the predictive model used the XGBoost 1.7.3 algorithm to predict the restorative benefit scores on the campus scale. The accessibility results from sDNA were then overlayed to form a comprehensive assessment matrix of restoration benefits and accessibility dimensions to identify further “areas with optimization potential”. In this way, three types of spatial dimensions (LRB-HA, HRB-LA, and LRB-LA) and sequential orders of temporal dimensions (short-term, medium-term, and long-term) were combined to propose optimization pathways for campus public space with the dual control of restorative benefits and accessibility. This study provides methodological guidelines and empirical data for campus regeneration and promotes outdoor public space efficiency. In addition, it can offer positive references for neighborhood-scale urban design and sustainable development. © 2025 by the authors.",accessibility; deep learning; restorative benefits; sDNA; street view images; university campus outdoor public spaces,accessibility; DNA; environmental restoration; GIS; machine learning; public space; satellite imagery; software; university sector,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52078113); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52078113).,"Wang, Jianguo, The digital presentation of human-oriented urban design, Sustainable Cities and Society, 97, (2023); Future of Cities Universities and Cities, (2015); Restorative Campus Landscapes Fostering Education Through Restoration, (2013); Ibrahim, Ahmed K., A systematic review of studies of depression prevalence in university students, Journal of Psychiatric Research, 47, 3, pp. 391-400, (2013); World Mental Health Report Transforming Mental Health for all; 2022 National Depression Blue Book; Hodson, Cody B., Green urban landscapes and school-level academic performance, Landscape and Urban Planning, 160, pp. 16-27, (2017); Kearns, Robin A., Placing therapeutic landscape as theoretical development in Health & Place, Health and Place, 61, (2020); Ning, Wei, Effects of brief exposure to campus environment on students' physiological and psychological health, Frontiers in Public Health, 11, (2023); Aghabozorgi, Koorosh, How university blue and green space affect students’ mental health: A scoping review, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 97, (2024)","J.

It analyzes data to identify patterns, creates tailored designs, enhances creativity, and allows designers to explore complex possibilities for diverse industries. This study uses a Gen-AI design generation process to develop an urban landscape fumigation service robot. This study proposes a machine-learned multimodal and feedback-based variational autoencoder (MMF-VAE) model that incorporates a readily available spraying robot dataset and includes design considerations from various research efforts to ensure real-time deployability. The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven and feedback-based approaches in generating design specifications for a fumigation robot with the targeted requirements of autonomous navigation, precision spraying, and an extended runtime. The design generation process comprises three stages: (1) parameter fixation, emphasizing functionality-based and aesthetic-based specifications; (2) design specification generation using the proposed MMF-VAE model with and without a spraying robot dataset; and (3) robot development based on the generated specifications. A comparative analysis evaluated the impact of the dataset-driven design generation. The design generated with the dataset proved more feasible and optimized for real-world deployment with the integration of multimodal inputs and iterative feedback refinement. A real-time prototype was then constructed using the model’s parametric constraints and tested in actual fumigation scenarios to validate operational viability. This study highlights the transformative potential of Gen-AI in robotic design workflows. © 2025 by the authors.",fumigation robot; generative design; multimodal design; urban landscape; variational autoencoder,Fumigation; Integrated circuit design; Microrobots; Robot learning; Variational techniques; Auto encoders; Design generation; Feed-back based; Fumigation robot; Generation process; Generative design; Multimodal design; Service robots; Urban landscape; Variational autoencoder; Machine design,,,,,"Beirut Arab University, BAU, (M22NBK0054); Beirut Arab University, BAU; (PIE-SGP-DZ-2023-01)","This research was supported by the National Robotics Programme under its National Robotics Programme (NRP) BAU, Ermine III: Deployable Reconfigurable Robots, Award No. M22NBK0054, and it was also supported by the SUTD Growth Plan (SGP) Grant, Grant Ref.

Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), support vector machine, random forest, and Deep Neural Network are employed to establish functional relationships between urban LST and its influencing factors. The machine learning approaches are trained and validated using remote sensing data from 2014, 2019, and 2024. Various explanatory variables representing topographical and spatial characteristics, as well as urban landscapes, are used. Experimental results show that LightGBM outperforms other benchmark methods. In addition, Shapley Additive Explanations are utilized to clarify the impact of the factors affecting LST. The analysis outcomes indicate that while the importance of these variables changes over time, urban density and greenspace density consistently emerge as the most influential factors. LightGBM attained R2 values of 0.85, 0.92, and 0.91 for the years 2014, 2019, and 2024, respectively.

However, there is a lack of understanding of how park settings influence usage patterns by socio-demographic characteristics. This study seeks to address this gap by exploring the association between park characteristics and gendered usage patterns across different times of the day. We employed big data analytics and computer vision techniques to analyze human behavior in two urban parks. These parks have comparable environments characterized by shared features, including paths, playgrounds, seating, lawns, greenery, and amenities. One is designed as a linear park, while the other is trapezoid-shaped. The distribution of facilities varies within the parks’ spaces. The key innovation of this approach lies in the use of computer vision for spatial analysis based on user-specific characteristics, particularly gender. City surveillance cameras are leveraged to gather extensive data on park usage. A comparative evaluation of the two urban parks includes a detailed examination of temporal and spatial usage patterns, offering new insights into the dynamics of urban park utilization. Findings reveal specific park features, such as playgrounds and paths, showed varying levels of utilization by different genders, highlighting the importance of tailored urban design. Males favored open lawns with dog facilities, whereas females preferred areas near playgrounds.

This shift prioritizes standardized functionality and energy efficiency over cultural identity, erasing regional architectural distinctiveness. In historical urban centers, globalization-driven interventions—such as ventilated facades or external thermal insulation systems (ETISs)—often simplify original compositions and alter building materiality, texture, and color. The Ensanche of San Sebastián serves as a case study highlighting this issue. Despite its architectural richness, which includes neoclassical and modernist buildings primarily constructed with sandstone from the Igeldo quarry, unprotected buildings are at risk of unsympathetic renovations. Such changes can distort the identity of what is considered “everyday heritage”, encompassing the residential buildings and public spaces that shape the collective memory of cities. This study presents a replicable methodology for assessing the vulnerability of buildings to facade interventions. By utilizing tools like digital twins, point cloud modeling, and typological analysis, the research establishes criteria for interventions aimed at preserving architectural values. It emphasizes the importance of collaborative efforts with urban planning authorities and public awareness campaigns to safeguard heritage. Ultimately, protecting architectural identity requires balancing the goals of energy efficiency with cultural preservation. This approach ensures that urban landscapes maintain their historical and social significance amidst globalization pressures. © 2025 by the authors.",AI; artificial intelligence; everyday heritage; facade simulation; loss of identity; vulnerability assessment,Facades; Green buildings; Historic preservation; Homogenization method; Thermal insulation; Urban growth; Complex geometric shapes; Cultural identity; Energy; Everyday heritage; Facade simulation; Globalisation; Loss of identity; Sebastian; Urban centers; Vulnerability assessments; Energy efficiency,,,,,(TR42004); (TR42367),This research has been made possible through funding from the KSIgune cluster for Cultural and Creative Industries (TR42004) and the San Sebasti\u00E1n City Council (TR42367).,"Sassen, Saskia, The global city: New York, London, Tokyo, pp. 1-397, (2013); Global Modernities, (1995); Kashf J Multidiscip Res, (2024); S M L Xl, (1995); Estoa Rev Fac De Arquit Urban Univ Cuenca, (2018); Identidades Asesinas, (1999); El Alegato Del Patrimonio, (1999); Luis Barragan La Busqueda De La Arquitectura Emocional, (2023); Int J Cult Herit Stud, (2020); Rev De Arquit Y Urban, (2022)","M.

The water distribution network (WDN) is one of the most important urban infrastructures in which optimal design and operation of it is essential during the operation period. For this purpose, in this research, artificial intelligence and data mining methods, including genetic programming (GP), gene expression programming (GEP), artificial neural network (ANN), and discrete wavelet transform function, are used to predict the daily drinking water consumption values of WDN. For this purpose, a dataset of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and daily water value of Najaf-Abad city in Iran is used during year 2014 to 2019. Here, hybrid models named W-GEP, W-GP, W-ANN, are proposed by equipping GEP, GP, and ANN with a wavelet transform function. In addition, two formulations are proposed for each model. Performance of proposed methods is investigated by determining R2, RMSE, and NSE statistical indices. For the training data of the W-GP model, the RMSE, NSE, and R2 values are 2810.46 (m3/day), 0.85, and 0.85, respectively, while for test and validation data these values are 2638.92 (m3/day), 0.87, and 0.87, respectively.

The previous studies conducted on Lahore lack the application of Geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) to quantify land use and land cover, which is successfully covered in this study. This study analyzes how urban sprawl has driven LULC shifts and assesses their direct impact on Land Surface Temperature (LST) using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. Landsat imagery, processed using Google Earth Engine (GEE), was employed for LULC classification and LST calculation, ensuring high accuracy through multi-level change detection and a thorough accuracy assessment. Pearson's correlation was also calculated in this study to assess the impact of decreased green cover on LST. The findings highlight a substantial decrease in green cover, from 1,292.8 km2 in 1990 to 754 km2 in 2020, alongside a marked increase in built-up areas, expanding from 262 km2 to over 550 km2. Additionally, barren land showed significant growth, while water bodies diminished. The spatiotemporal analysis of LST indicates a considerable rise in high-temperature zones, specifically the industrial zones, with areas exceeding 40 °C expanding from 2 km2 to 1,075 km2 over the study period. A strong positive correlation between increased urbanization and rising LST, particularly in areas within a 10 to 40 km radius of the Central Business District (CBD), is evident. The overall accuracy of LULC classification surpassed 94%, with the kappa coefficient above 92%, ensuring the robustness of the results. Future research should focus on evaluating the long-term socioeconomic impacts of urban sprawl and LST increment while developing heat mitigation strategies. Recommendations include adopting sustainable urban planning practices prioritizing green infrastructure, energy-efficient building designs, and policies promoting environmental preservation.

Existing evaluation methods, primarily relying on top-down static structured data, struggle to comprehensively capture dynamic public perceptions and evaluations of commercial BE elements. Social media big data offers a novel perspective for evaluating commercial space, providing rich time series and semantic information. However, this potential remains underutilized in current research. This study proposes a fine-grained method for Commercial Built Environment perception and Evaluation based on Social media (CBEES), integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with deep learning models to extract detailed semantic information from unstructured text, enabling a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of commercial BE. Initially, CBEES employs NLP techniques to identify BE element feature variables, utilizing a Cross-Attention Mechanism to calculate element weights. Then, CBEES applies a sentiment classification algorithm based on a fine-tuned BERT model to assess public sentiment polarity. Finally, CBEES conducts dynamic and static evaluations of commercial BE using time series analysis and Random Forest classification models. Experiments using social media text data from 12 commercial projects in Wuhan identified 48 commercial BE elements. The results revealed significant temporal differences in BE element evaluations, with notable changes in negative sentiment during the initial COVID-19 reopening phase. Static evaluations identified Food street (8.4 %), Crowd (7.9 %), and Stair/Elevator (5.6 %) as key elements influencing public perception. SHapley Additive exPlanations uncovered non-linear relationships between certain BE elements and perception evaluations. CBEES provides a novel methodological framework for fine-grained monitoring of commercial BE and responding to changes in public demands, enhancing the sustainability of urban commercial space planning, design, and operational management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Commercial space; Natural language processing; Public perception evaluation; Social media data,Built environment; Commercial space; Fine grained; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Public perception; Public perception evaluation; Social media; Social medium data; demand analysis; industrial district; industrial location; land use planning; machine learning; perception; planning process; quantitative analysis; social media; space use; sustainability; urban area; urban design; urban economy; urban planning,,,,,,,"Alrefaie, Mohamed Taher, Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear event detection and classification using ontology interrogation and social media data, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 135, (2024); Apardian, Rebekka E., The role of neighborhood characteristics for firm performance in the experience economy: A case study of production volumes in California's Brewpub industry, Journal of Urban Management, 11, 2, pp. 214-225, (2022); Aprigliano, Vicente, Effects of the built environment and sociodemographic factors on accessibility in the city of Valparaíso, Chile, Journal of Transport Geography, 118, (2024); Ashayeri, Mehdi, Unraveling energy justice in NYC urban buildings through social media sentiment analysis and transformer deep learning, Energy and Buildings, 306, (2024); Balasubramanian, Sanjana, Aesthetics of urban commercial streets from the perspective of cognitive memory and user behavior in urban environments, Frontiers of Architectural Research, 11, 5, pp. 949-962, (2022); Castanha, Jick, A Systematic Literature Review on Natural Language Processing (NLP), (2022); Chang, Hanbit, Places “for the gram”: Millennials, specialty coffee bars and the gentrification of commercial streets in Seoul, Geoforum, 139, (2023); Chen, Yiqiao, The road to recovery: Sensing public opinion towards reopening measures with social media data in post-lockdown cities, Cities, 132, (2023); Chen, Zhengyan, Exploring the impact of seasonal forest landscapes on tourist emotions using Machine learning, Ecological Indicators, 163, (2024); Coisnon, Thomas, Disentangling public urban green space satisfaction: Exploring individual and contextual factors across European cities, Cities, 152, (2024)","X.

We employ an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach on publicly accessible Airbnb data to identify optimal Airbnb rental features, predict price trends, and understand Airbnb's growth in Dublin. Our analysis also integrates features from three main categories: physical geography (e.g., elevation), social geography (e.g., Electoral Division), and infrastructure & economic geography based on housing/rental market theories (e.g., distance from the city centre). This integration of geographical attributes with ML algorithms provides localised insights into Airbnb pricing dynamics, addressing gaps in previous research that often overlooked the impact of geographical features on price prediction. By applying the TreeSHAP utility (tree-based attribute for SHapley Additive exPlanations), we establish the significant role of these geographical features in predicting Airbnb rental prices, thereby reinforcing theories like Alonso's Bid-Rent Theory. We further validate the robustness of our models through testing procedures.

While macro-level built environment attributes (e.g., land use) have been widely acknowledged in relation to the role they play in urban traffic safety, the effects of micro-level streetscape characteristics on crash frequency have not been investigated to any significant extent. Moreover, the associations between these environmental features and crashes in school zones remains largely unknown. To address this issue, we first identified school zone-related crash hotspot using spatiotemporal hotspot mining on a comprehensive dataset of 20,484 pedestrian-vehicle crashes between 2017 and 2021 in Seoul, South Korea. Streetscape characteristics were analysed using street view imagery and advanced computer vision techniques to extract and classify pixel-wise visual elements. Preliminary findings reveal spatiotemporal variations in fatal and severe injury (FSI) crashes, with school zones in central commercial and industrial areas emerging as persistent crash hotspots that have remained statistically significant hotspots for 90 % of the study period. Further impact analysis using interpretable machine learning helped to uncover the non-linear relationships between both micro and macro environmental features and FSI frequency. Lower levels of street enclosure and walkability were associated with a higher frequency of FSI crashes, while increased openness and imageability were also correlated with more FSI incidents. Additionally, street greenery was found to reduce FSI crashes once it reached a certain threshold. Our findings extend existing knowledge of how the built environment and streetscape design influence pedestrian safety in school zones, paving the way for more targeted interventions to plan safer pedestrian environments around schools. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Interpretable machine learning; Pedestrian crash; School zone; Spatiotemporal; Street environment,machine learning; pedestrian; spatiotemporal analysis; urban design; urban transport; Seoul [Seoul (ADS)]; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea,,,,,"Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement, KAIA; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT, (RS-2022-00156089); Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT",This research was supported by a Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant funded by the Korean government (MOLIT) (RS-2022-00156089).,"An, Rui, Examining non-linear built environment effects on injurious traffic collisions: A gradient boosting decision tree analysis, Journal of Transport and Health, 24, (2022); Ashraf, Md Tanvir, Investigation of pedestrian and bicyclist safety in public transportation systems, Journal of Transport and Health, 27, (2022); Azimian, Amin, Exploring the effects of area-level factors on traffic crash frequency by severity using multivariate space-time models, Analytic Methods in Accident Research, 31, (2021); Global High Resolution Population Denominators Project, (2025); Cantillo, Víctor, An exploratory analysis of factors associated with traffic crashes severity in Cartagena, Colombia, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 146, (2020); Chang, Haoliang, Investigating the temporal dynamics of motor vehicle collision density patterns in urban road networks – A case study of New York, Journal of Safety Research, 89, pp. 116-134, (2024); Chen, Peng, Effects of the built environment on automobile-involved pedestrian crash frequency and risk, Journal of Transport and Health, 3, 4, pp. 448-456, (2016); Chen, Liangchieh, Encoder-decoder with atrous separable convolution for semantic image segmentation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11211 LNCS, pp. 833-851, (2018); Chen, Tiantian, Analysing the main and interaction effects of commercial vehicle mix and roadway attributes on crash rates using a Bayesian random-parameter Tobit model, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 154, (2021); Chen, Yanyan, Research on the influencing factors of elderly pedestrian traffic accidents considering the built environment, International Review for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development, 11, 1, pp. 44-63, (2023)","I.

To encourage such activities, understanding urban bikeability at both detailed and broad spatial scales is crucial. Street view imagery (SVI) offers in-depth insights into how street features influence micro-mobility patterns, but existing studies are mainly correlational. This research utilized historical time-series SVI, cyclist data from London, to discern the causal effects of specific urban features on cyclist numbers. We used propensity score matching to adjust for potential confounding biases and applied the causal forest to estimate the heterogeneity in causal effects. Key findings include: vegetation significantly boosts cycling, slope negatively impacts cycling, and bike lanes positively influence cycling. Moreover, vegetation's impact on cycling is greater in less populated areas, while bike lanes have a stronger effect in densely populated regions. These findings help prioritize the areas of intervention. By transcending from mere correlations to identifying heterogeneous causal impacts, this study offers invaluable insights for urban planning, underscoring design strategies to enhance cities’ bikeability and sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Active transportation; Causal forest; Deep learning; Propensity score matching; Urban design,Active transportations; Built environment; Causal forest; Deep learning; Micro-mobility; Mobility pattern; Propensity score matching; Spatial scale; Times series; Urban design; Abiotic; heterogeneity; machine learning; sustainable development; time series analysis; urban design,,,,,"National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-295-000-171-133); National University of Singapore, NUS","The first author is thankful for funding provided by the Singapore International Graduate Research Award scholarship.

With the increase in urban population density and traffic flow, optimizing urban environmental design to elevate residents’ sense of safety has become a key issue in urban planning and management. However, the existing studies face numerous challenges in conducting large-scale quantitative analysis of environmental safety perception in complex scenarios, such as difficulties in data acquisition and limitations in analytical methods. This study addresses these challenges by applying image semantic segmentation and object detection techniques to extract key visual elements from street view images, combined with manual scoring and deep learning methods, to construct a road safety perception dataset. Using a LightGBM model and the SHAP interpretation framework, in this study, we identify the critical visual factors influencing environmental safety perception. An empirical study was conducted in Macau, a modern city where Eastern and Western cultures intersect, and tourism thrives. The findings reveal that: ① The overall environmental safety perception in the eight parishes and surrounding roads of Macau is relatively high, with significant regional differences in safety perception scores around Macau’s parish roads; ② The proportions of buildings, sidewalks, roads, and trees in images are the four primary factors influencing environmental safety perception; ③ The proportions and quantities of visual elements interact with each other, and their reasonable distribution helps form clear spatial visibility and creates conducive activity spaces, thereby enhancing the perception of environmental safety. Through empirical analysis, this study uncovers the mechanisms by which visual elements in urban street scenes affect environmental safety perception, providing scientific evidence for urban planning and transportation environment improvement.

Understanding the temporal variation of the relationship between PM<inf>10</inf> and geographical parameters is crucial for sustainable land use planning and air quality management in European landscapes. This study utilizes Conditional Inference Forest modeling and partial correlation to examine the impact of geographical factors on monthly average concentrations of PM<inf>10</inf> in European suburban and urban landscapes during heating and cooling periods. The investigation focuses on two buffer zones (1000 m and 3000 m circle radiuses) surrounding 1216 European air quality monitoring stations. Results: Results reveal importance and significant correlations between various geographical variables (soil texture, land use, transportation network, and meteorological) and PM<inf>10</inf> quality on a continental scale. In suburban landscapes, soil texture, temperature, roads, and rail density play pivotal roles, while meteorological variables, particularly monthly average temperature and wind speed, dominate in urban landscapes. Urban sites exhibit higher R-squared values during both cooling (0.41) and heating periods (0.61) compared to suburban sites (cooling period R-squared: 0.39; heating period: R-squared: 0.51), indicating better predictive performance likely attributed to the less heterogeneous land use patterns surrounding urban PM<inf>10</inf> monitoring sites. Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of investigating spatial and temporal dynamics of geographical factors for accurate PM<inf>10</inf> air quality prediction models in European urban and suburban landscapes. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and environmental scientists, guiding efforts toward sustainable and healthier urban environments. © The Author(s) 2024.",Land use; Meteorological condition; Particulate matter; Random forest; Soil texture; Spatiotemporal variability,Air quality; Quality management; Random forests; Urban transportation; Geographical parameters; Heating period; Machine learning algorithms; Meteorological condition; Particulate Matter; PM 10; Soil textures; Spatiotemporal variability; Urban landscape; Wind; algorithm; land use planning; machine learning; meteorology; particulate matter; soil texture; spatial variation; temporal variation,,,,,,,"Abbey, David E., Long-term inhalable particles and other air pollutants related to mortality in nonsmokers, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 159, 2, pp. 373-382, (1999); Alhems, Luai M., Comprehensive review of cooling and heating degree days characteristics over Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 27, pp. 305-314, (2013); Alizadeh, Omid, Temporal and spatial variations of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants in the urban area of Tehran, Atmospheric Environment, 141, pp. 443-453, (2016); Analitis, Antonis, Prediction of PM2.5 concentrations at the locations of monitoring sites measuring PM10 and NOx, using generalized additive models and machine learning methods: A case study in London, Atmospheric Environment, 240, (2020); Bai, Lu, Air pollution forecasts: An overview, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 4, (2018); Ballabio, Cristiano, Mapping topsoil physical properties at European scale using the LUCAS database, Geoderma, 261, pp. 110-123, (2016); Barrero, M.

In this paper, the multi-sensor collaborative filtering algorithm is optimized, and a method based on evidence theory is proposed to deal with the fuzzy and unclear information generated in the process of multi-sensor collaboration. Then, the analysis and recognition of multi-sensor fusion information using AI technology are analyzed in detail. This paper discusses the problems in multi-sensor information fusion and related solutions. Combined with the key nodes of 3D object AI feature recognition, multi-sensor collaborative Dempster Shafer evidence theory and 3D convolutional neural network waterfront space landscape feature recognition sub-model are constructed, and the waterfront space landscape recognition analysis model is tested and analyzed. The results show that the multi-sensor information collection Kalman filtering fusion algorithm effectively realizes the recognition of landscape feature information and the filtering of irrelevant interference information combined with an artificial intelligence algorithm to build a landscape feature recognition model. Among all kinds of landscape recognition, the recognition effect of beach inflow is the best, and the recognition accuracy, recall, and F1 value are all above 95. However, the identification effect of hydrophilic plank roads and underwater breakwater is relatively poor. The recognition accuracy of the hydrophilic platform is the lowest at 83.16 % among the eight landscape types, and the recall rate of underwater breakwater is the lowest at 79.96 % among the eight landscape types. In general, the multi-sensor Kalman filtering algorithm information fusion model designed in this paper has higher recognition accuracy and better classification performance for the collection and classification of the entire landscape dataset. The work of this paper provides a new idea and direction for the design and application of waterfront landscape identification and analysis systems based on intelligent sensors and artificial intelligence technology and lays a certain foundation for the intelligent design of urban waterfront landscapes. © 2024",Artificial intelligence feature recognition; Intelligent sensor; Multi-sensor information fusion; Recognition and classification of waterfront landscape features; Three-dimensional sensor information recognition; Waterfront landscape,Breakwaters; Convolutional neural networks; Information fusion; Kalman filters; Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Artificial intelligence feature recognition; Features recognition; Information recognition; Intelligent sensors; Landscape feature; Multi-sensor information fusion; Recognition and classification of waterfront landscape feature; Sensor informations; Three-dimensional sensor; Three-dimensional sensor information recognition; Waterfront landscape; Collaborative filtering,,,,,"(2021SJA0403); (2021–2024, NYXT2022016)","Research project of philosophy and social science in universities in Jiangsu Province (2021SJA0403), Research on the design of urban public reading space from the perspective of creating space vitality; Research project of Cultural creativity and collaborative innovation in universities in Jiangsu Province (2021\u20132024), (NYXT2022016), Design of community children's micro sports facilities from the perspective of promoting physical activity.","2019 International Conference on Organizational Innovation Icoi 2019, (2019); J Green Sci Technol, (2017); International Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research Ijair, (2022); Shi, Han, Systematic analysis of a military wearable device based on a multi-level fusion framework: Research directions, Sensors, 19, 12, (2019); Landsc Arch Aust, (2021); Gong, Yuming, A new multi-sensor fusion target recognition method based on complementarity analysis and neutrosophic set, Symmetry, 12, 9, (2020); Liu, Tianbi, A Novel Multi-Sensor Fusion Based Object Detection and Recognition Algorithm for Intelligent Assisted Driving, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 81564-81574, (2021); Lu, Liping, Datafusion method of multi-sensor target recognition in complex environment, Xi'an Dianzi Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Xidian University, 47, 4, pp. 31-38, (2020); Meng, Zeng, PINN-FORM: A new physics-informed neural network for reliability analysis with partial differential equation, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 414, (2023); Erdaş, Mehmet Umut, Optimum design of a seat bracket using artificial neural networks and dandelion optimization algorithm, Materialpruefung/Materials Testing, 65, 12, pp. 1767-1775, (2023)",,,Academic Press,,,,,,27729419,,,,English,Syst.

This field often entails extensive civic involvement and collaborative partnerships with institutions. Its overarching objectives span a spectrum from preserving water quality, habitat, and biodiversity to mitigating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. The UHI phenomenon, characterized by notably higher temperatures in urban areas compared to rural counterparts due to heat absorption by urban infrastructure and limited urban forest coverage, serves as a focal point in this study. The study focuses on developing a methodological framework that integrates Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Random Forest (RF), and Suitability Analysis to assess the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect across different urban zones, aiming to identify areas with varying levels of UHI impact. The framework is designed to assist urban planners and designers in understanding the spatial distribution of UHI and identifying areas where urban forestry initiatives can be strategically implemented to mitigate its effect. Conducted in various London areas, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of the intricate relationship between urban and community forestry and UHI. By mapping the spatial variability of UHI, the framework offers a novel approach to enhancing urban environmental design and advancing urban forestry studies. The study’s findings are expected to provide valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers, aiding in creating healthier and more livable urban environments through informed decision-making in urban forestry management. © The Author(s) 2024.",Geographically weighted regression; Random forest; Urban and community forestry; Urban heat island,Atmospheric temperature; Biodiversity; Decision making; Environmental management; Forestry; Sustainable development; Timber; Urban planning; Collaborative partnerships; Community forestry; Design frameworks; Geographically weighted regression; Random forests; Spectra's; Urban forestry; Urban heat island; Urban Heat Island Effects; Urban planners; Water quality; climate change; community forestry; forest management; heat island; machine learning; mitigation; resilience; spatial distribution; urban area; urban design; urban forestry; London,,,,,,,"Andoni, Heri, A Review on Mitigation Technologies for Controlling Urban Heat Island Effect in Housing and Settlement Areas, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 152, 1, (2018); Muzamil Basha, Syed Muzamil, Survey on Evaluating the Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms: Past Contributions and Future Roadmap, pp. 153-164, (2019); Bornstein, Robert D., Urban heat islands and summertime convective thunderstorms in Atlanta: Three case studies, Atmospheric Environment, 34, 3, pp. 507-516, (2000); Chen, Hui, Spatial patterns of associations among ecosystem services across different spatial scales in metropolitan areas: A case study of Shanghai, China, Ecological Indicators, 136, (2022); Chen, Mingze, Evaluating implied urban nature vitality in San Francisco: An interdisciplinary approach combining census data, street view images, and social media analysis, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 95, (2024); Collins, C.

However, getting high resolution multi-faceted data about a city has been a challenge. Further, even when the data were available the integration into a model is even more of a challenge due to the parametric needs, and the data volumes. Further, even if this is achieved, the cities themselves continually evolve rendering the data obsolete, thus necessitating a fast and repeatable data capture mechanism. We have shown that by using AI/graphics community advances we can create a seamless opportunity for high resolution models. Instead of assuming every physical and behavioral detail is sensed, a generative and procedural approach seeks to computationally infer a fully detailed 3D fit-for-purpose model of an urban space. We present a perspective building on recent success results of this generative approach applied to urban design and planning at different scales, for different components of the urban landscape, and related applications. The opportunities now possible with such a generative model for urban modeling open a wide range of opportunities as this becomes mainstream. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial intelligence; Generative AI; Urban computational science; Urban modeling,Climate models; Urban planning; Climate assessment; Climate simulation; Computational science; Data volume; Generative AI; High resolution; Numerical prediction models; Urban computational science; Urban modeling; Weather simulation; Artificial intelligence,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1835739, 1816514, 2106717, 2032770); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work has been funded by several US NSF grants including #1835739, #1816514, #2106717, and #2032770.","Bauer, Peter, A digital twin of Earth for the green transition, Nature Climate Change, 11, 2, pp. 80-83, (2021); Chen, Fei, The integrated WRF/urban modelling system: Development, evaluation, and applications to urban environmental problems, International Journal of Climatology, 31, 2, pp. 273-288, (2011); Ching, Jason K.S., WUDAPT: An urban weather, climate, and environmental modeling infrastructure for the anthropocene, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 99, 9, pp. 1907-1924, (2018); Cho, Adrian, At DOE, efforts to address climate and diversity dovetail, Science, 372, 6549, (2021); Estrada, F., A global economic assessment of city policies to reduce climate change impacts, Nature Climate Change, 7, 6, pp. 403-406, (2017); Firoze, Adnan M., Tree Instance Segmentation with Temporal Contour Graph, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2023-June, pp. 2193-2202, (2023); Firoze, Adnan M., Urban tree generator: spatio-temporal and generative deep learning for urban tree localization and modeling, Visual Computer, 38, 9-10, pp. 3327-3339, (2022); He, Liu, GlobalMapper: Arbitrary-Shaped Urban Layout Generation, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 454-464, (2023); He, Liu, Generative Building Feature Estimation From Satellite Images, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 61, (2023); Hu, Chenxi, Mega-city development impact on hourly extreme rainfall over the South China Greater Bay Area under near-future climate warming, Urban Climate, 48, (2023)","D.

In Singapore, domestic electricity usage in public residential buildings takes up a significant portion of the country's annual energy consumption. Having effective forecasting approaches is thus important in supporting relevant strategies and policy making. In this research, we proposed a hybrid approach that was based on a combination of building characteristics and urban landscape variables to predict residential housing electricity usage in Singapore. XGboost was also incorporated inside the hybrid approach as the preferred machine learning approach for energy consumption predictions. To demonstrate our proposed approach's predictive strength, the performance of our proposed hybrid machine learning approach was compared with two other models, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model and the Random Forest (RF) model. Results showed that our proposed hybrid model had outperformed these abovementioned approaches with higher accuracy (r2 value of 0.9).

Urban expansion is altering the permeability of the land, thus increasing the risk of flooding. This study investigates the impact of urban morphology on pluvial floodwater distribution in 15 urban catchments across England, UK, to provide an analysis of how urban morphology influences flood magnitude. Using a cellular automata-based model, pluvial flood simulations were conducted for catchments characterized by diverse urban morphologies. Then a series of machine learning models were adopted to reveal the relationships between the morphological characteristics of urban configurations (e.g., building footprints, impervious surfaces, street network, topography) and pluvial flooding. These models were used to identify and quantify the effects of key urban morphological indicators on pluvial flooding. The results indicate that, although the total area of impervious surfaces plays the most significant role in floodwater distribution, the edge density (ED) of building footprints and impervious surfaces also influences this process. Synthetic experiments with an exemplary urban fabric show that decreasing “ED of building footprint” and increasing “ED of impervious surface” can mitigate flood volume by up to 6.3 % at 100 % drainage efficiency and 7.8 % at 50 % efficiency. The results of this study are anticipated to aid urban planners and policymakers in developing strategies for implementing flood-resilient cities. © 2024",Flood mitigation; Machine learning; Urban morphology; Urban pluvial floods,Catchments; Drainage; Runoff; Urban growth; Building footprint; Edge densities; Flood mitigation; Impervious surface; Machine-learning; Pluvial flooding; Pluvials; Urban catchment; Urban morphology; Urban pluvial flood; Climate change; catchment; cellular automaton; flood control; flood frequency; flooding; hazard assessment; machine learning; permeability; policy making; rainfall-runoff modeling; strategic approach; urban design; urban morphology; urban planning; article; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; controlled study; England; flood mitigation; human; morphological trait; morphology; rain; simulation; topography; United Kingdom,,,,,"National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; National University of Singapore, NUS; Nanyang Technological University, NTU; Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH; University of Exeter; Singapore University of Technology and Design, SUTD","This research was funded in part by the Future Cities Lab Global programme.

Owing to the population’s fluctuating needs, a new and dual perspective of urban space emerges. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) of a territory, or the system of technical diligence associated with the anthropocentric world, makes sense in the context of this temporal mismatch between territorial processes and utilitarian apparatus. This creates cerebral connections between several concurrent decision-making systems, leading to numerous perspectives of the same urban environment, often filtered by the people whose interests direct the information flow till the transformability. In contrast to the conventional methodologies of decision analysis, which are employed to facilitate convenient judgments between alternative options, innovative Artificial Intelligence tools are gaining traction as a means of more effectively evaluating and selecting fast-track solutions. The study’s goal is to investigate the cross-functional relationships between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and current decision-making support systems, which are increasingly being used to interpret urban growth and development from a multi-dimensional perspective, such as a multi-criteria one. Individuals in charge of administering and governing a territory will gain from artificial intelligence techniques because they will be able to test resilience and responsibility in decision-making circumstances while also responding fast and spontaneously to community requirements. The study evaluates current grading techniques and recommends areas for future upgrades via the lens of the potentials afforded by AI technology to the establishment of digitization pathways for technological advancements in the urban valuation. © 2024 by the authors.",AI; MCDA; scoping review; urban environment,Brain computer interface; Decision making; Decision support systems; 'current; Decision-making process; Intelligence integration; Landscape changes; MCDA; Multicriteria analysis; Process convergence; Scoping review; Urban environments; Urban landscape; Urban growth,,,,,,,"Nyholm, Sven R., Meaning in Life in AI Ethics—Some Trends and Perspectives, Philosophy and Technology, 36, 2, (2023); Furman, Jason, AI and the economy, Innovation Policy and the Economy, 19, 1, pp. 161-191, (2019); Fosso Wamba, Samuel, Industry experiences of artificial intelligence (AI): benefits and challenges in operations and supply chain management, Production Planning and Control, 33, 16, pp. 1493-1497, (2022); Robbins, Scott A., Our New Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure: Becoming Locked into an Unsustainable Future, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 8, (2022); Bell, Samuel J., Modeling the Machine Learning Multiverse, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, (2022); Peng, Zhongren, The Pathway of Urban Planning AI: From Planning Support to Plan-Making, Journal of Planning Education and Research, 44, 4, pp. 2263-2279, (2024); Danziger, Shai, Extraneous factors in judicial decisions, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108, 17, pp. 6889-6892, (2011); Human Machine Reimagining Work in the Age of AI, (2018); Mahroof, Kamran, A human-centric perspective exploring the readiness towards smart warehousing: The case of a large retail distribution warehouse, International Journal of Information Management, 45, pp. 176-190, (2019); Horvitz, Eric J., Decision theory in expert systems and artificial intelligence, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 2, 3, pp. 247-302, (1988)","F.

Hence, this study aims to quantify spatio-temporal trajectories of urban growth in Asansol City during 1991–2021, using integrated remote sensing and GIS-based techniques. Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI/TIRS satellite imageries were used to delineate built-up and non-built-up areas using a random forest machine-learning algorithm. The study utilized the gradient approach, urban sprawl typologies, urban expansion indices, shannon's entropy, and landscape fragmentation metrics to analyze the pattern, direction, intensity and dynamics of urban expansion in a space-time context. The findings showed that built-up growth increased significantly from 25.49 sq. km. to 57.18 sq. km. between 1991 and 2021, with the highest growth observed in the westward direction and within 3 km from the CBD. The study highlighted the prevalence of edge expansion and scatter development as dominant typologies of urban growth. Urban expansion indices, shannon's entropy and landscape fragmentation metrics analysis revealed the increasing urban sprawl towards the periphery and the formation of clustered built-up areas near the CBD.

Therefore, optimizing urban block design in the early stages contributes to enhancing urban energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. However, widely used multi-objective optimization methods based on performance simulation face the challenges of high computational loads and low efficiency. This study introduces a framework using machine learning, especially the XGBoost model, to accelerate multi-objective optimization of energy-efficient urban block forms. A residential block in Nanjing serves as the case study. The framework commences with a parametric block form model driven by design variables, focusing on minimizing building energy consumption (EUI), maximizing photovoltaic energy generation (PVE) and outdoor sunlight hours (SH). Data generated through Latin Hypercube Sampling and performance simulations inform the model training. Through training and hyperparameter tuning, XGBoost’s predictive accuracy was validated against artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) models. Subsequently, XGBoost replaced traditional performance simulations, conducting multi-objective optimization via the NSGA-II algorithm. Results showcase the framework’s significant acceleration of the optimization process, improving computational efficiency by over 420 times and producing 185 Pareto optimal solutions with improved performance metrics. SHAP analysis highlighted shape factor (SF), building density (BD), and building orientation (BO) as key morphological parameters influencing EUI, PVE, and SH.

Thirty experts in architecture and urban planning made up its statistical population. A combination of artificial intelligence algorithms, tree data mining techniques, and the FTOPSIS multi-criteria decision analysis method have been applied to the information analysis process. A panel of experts was formed to gather information, and the criteria of housing design that had evolved in the post-corona period were identified by designing a questionnaire on the Likert scale (i.e., a psychometric scale named after its inventor)—the primary influential factors in the pattern of housing architecture after the Corona period were determined. The findings showed a significant correlation between housing architecture in the post-corona period and people's health patterns. Results showed that the factors that have the most significant impact on the evolution of housing in the region under investigation include the new function of housing (0.152), changing behavioral interactions (0.152), design criteria (0.145) and the passive ventilation factor with a score of 0.113. Other results showed that the physical distance as well as quarantine and isolation components obtained a score of 0.359 and 0.328, respectively, and were identified as the most critical developments in housing architecture. Finally, data mining findings showed that the spatial quality variable in the first phase had the most significant influence on the growth and fortification of the evolution of housing components at the study area level and the promotion of the health of people in the community in the post-pandemic period. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Architectural design; COVID-19 pandemic mitigation; House design; Hybrid methods,Analysis method; Analytical approach; Artificial intelligence algorithms; COVID-19 pandemic mitigation; Data-mining techniques; House design; Housing architecture; Hybrid method; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Tree data; architectural design; COVID-19; housing; public health; urban design,,,,,"Department of Education of Guangdong Province, DEGP, (2021KTSCX004); Department of Education of Guangdong Province, DEGP; (2021-K2-305243); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2023A1515011137, 2024A1515012129, 2024A04J9930); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province; (2024ZB06); (GD22XGL02)","This research is supported by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (grant no. 2024A1515012129 and grant no. 2023A1515011137); State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building and Urban Science, South China University of Technology (grant no. 2024ZB06); the 2022 Guangdong Philosophy and Social Science Foundation (grant no.

Fine-grained LCZ mapping considering spatial and temporal heterogeneity can provide a more precise characterization of surface thermal properties, thereby enabling a comprehensive analysis and understanding of spatiotemporal trends in climate change research. However, data-driven deep learning-based methods have limitations in coping with the complex urban landscapes of the real-world scenarios, including the spectral similarity of different LCZ and the geospatial heterogeneity of urban LCZ categories. In this study, we constructed a geographic knowledge base for enhanced LCZ characterization with the consideration of prior surface spatial information, including a set of spectral indices and urban morphological parameters (UMPs). Then, we integrated the explicable geographic knowledge base into a learnable deep learning framework in an end-to-end manner for accurate LCZ mapping by fusing multi-source heterogeneous data with a multi-level fusion strategy. The constructed Chinese Climate Zone Time Series LCZ (CClimate-TLCZ) dataset derived from Landsat-8 data with a 30 m spatial resolution, covering 18 representative cities in China, were used to evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieved optimal outcomes across 18 cities, with an average overall accuracy exceeding 94 %, which is more than 20 % higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Furthermore, the analysis of LCZ mapping-driven land surface temperature (LST) and surface UHI (SUHI) applications shows that cities within the same climate zone have similar LST distribution patterns, while significant heterogeneity exist between different zones. The annual consistency of LST patterns within each climate zone supports the validity of the LCZ classification scheme and accurate LCZ mapping for urban thermal environment studies. From 2016 to 2022, SUHI intensity initially increases and then decreases, indicating improvements in the urban thermal environment. These findings underscore the critical role of precise LCZ mapping in urban climate resilience and sustainable urban planning. © 2024 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Through the development and application of a LUR-based Bayesian Network (BN) model to detailed, mobile-based BC measurements, we have successfully decoded the causal relationships and conditional probabilities linking diverse urban land use variables to BC levels. The BN model demonstrates notable prediction accuracy on the test set, with an R2 of 0.59 and an NRMSE of 0.65. Among the varied land use variables analyzed, proximity to the port is identified as the dominant factor contributing to BC hotspots. Moreover, the synergistic effect of port proximity and truck routes emerges as a key driver of spatially clustered BC hotspots, a complex phenomenon not adequately captured by conventional machine learning and deep learning models. The insights revealed through this study are vital not just for enhancing air pollution prediction and exposure analysis but also for informing urban planning and policymaking, offering valuable, actionable insights. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollution prediction; Bayesian network model; Black carbon; Explainable machine learning; Land use,Air pollution; Bayesian networks; Carbon; Complex networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Air pollution predictions; Bayesian network models; Black carbon; Carbon concentrations; Explainable machine learning; Hotspots; Land-use regression models; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Urban landscape; Land use; black carbon; accuracy assessment; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; land use; machine learning; prediction; urban area; urban planning; air pollution; analytic method; Article; Bayesian network; built environment; city planning; controlled study; cross validation; decision making; deep learning; highway; histogram; human; measurement accuracy; pollution exposure,,,,,"European Defence Fund, EDF","Apte et al. (2017) developed and applied a sophisticated data reduction and aggregation algorithm to transform these instantaneous observations into estimates of median annual weekday concentrations for each 30-m segment of road within the study area. Our research focuses on the subset of these aggregated annual median BC concentration values, which are depicted in Fig. 1. We have more than 5500 segments of 30 m roadway, each with a BC annual median concentration. The weekday annual median BC concentration dataset is available from both Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) website (EDF, 2024) and Apte et al. (2017) supporting information.Building on the approach from Tang et al. (2023), we utilized the same 45 features selected from the initial 108 variables, through a Genetic Algorithm (GA), as detailed in Section S1 of the supporting information. The GA method effectively narrowed down the most influential variables and multi-collinearity issues, thereby reducing the complexity of our BN model and enhancing the interpretability of the results. In conclusion, this study constructs a hybrid LUR model through the integration of land use variables with a BN model. The BN model serves as the regression mechanism for the conventional LUR model. Moreover, the interpretability of the BN model elucidates the influence of land use variables on BC concentrations within complex urban landscapes.Fig. 4 visualizes the correlations between land use variables and log-transformed BC concentrations. It also supports our expert knowledge and assumptions in creating the DAG for BN model construction. All the land use variables show relatively significant (correlation coefficient with absolute value greater than 0.5) correlations with BC concentrations, suggesting their dependencies. The same land use variables with different buffer scales are also highly correlated, while different land use variables are less correlated.In the Supporting Information section S2, we have detailed the model coefficients for our fully trained BN model. Utilizing this model, we can investigate the relative importance and conditional probabilities of different land use variables in influencing BC concentrations.","Ademujimi, Toyosi, Model-Driven Bayesian Network Learning for Factory-Level Fault Diagnostics and Resilience, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 2, (2024); Apte, Joshua S., Ambient PM2.5 Reduces Global and Regional Life Expectancy, Environmental Science and Technology Letters, 5, 9, pp. 546-551, (2018); Apte, Joshua S., High-Resolution Air Pollution Mapping with Google Street View Cars: Exploiting Big Data, Environmental Science and Technology, 51, 12, pp. 6999-7008, (2017); Borna, Mehrdad, Evaluating the Influence of Urban Blocks on Air Pollution Concentration Levels: The Case Study of Golden Lane Estate in London, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 2, (2024); Rodríguez Núñez, Martín, Quantifying the contribution of environmental variables to cyclists’ exposure to PM2.5 using machine learning techniques, Heliyon, 10, 2, (2024); Cohen, Aaron J., Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015, The Lancet, 389, 10082, pp. 1907-1918, (2017); Gupta, Aman, A systematic review on urban blue-green infrastructure in the south Asian region: recent advancements, applications, and challenges, Water Science and Technology, 89, 2, pp. 382-403, (2024); Di, Qian, An ensemble-based model of PM2.5 concentration across the contiguous United States with high spatiotemporal resolution, Environment International, 130, (2019); Di, Qian, Assessing PM2.5 Exposures with High Spatiotemporal Resolution across the Continental United States, Environmental Science and Technology, 50, 9, pp. 4712-4721, (2016); Environ Def Fund, (2024)","X.

A comprehensive assessment of urban landscapes is crucial for guiding the development of inclusive, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements. Previous studies have primarily analyzed two-dimensional landscape indicators derived from satellite remote sensing, potentially overlooking the valuable insights provided by the three-dimensional configuration of landscapes. This limitation arises from the high cost of acquiring large-area three-dimensional data and the lack of effective assessment indicators. Here, we propose four urban landscapes indicators in three dimensions (UL3D): greenness, grayness, openness, and crowding. We construct the UL3D using 4.03 million street view images from 303 major cities in China, employing a deep learning approach. We combine urban background and two-dimensional urban landscape indicators with UL3D to predict the socioeconomic profiles of cities. The results show that UL3D indicators differs from two-dimensional landscape indicators, with a low average correlation coefficient of 0.31 between them. Urban landscapes had a changing point in 2018–2019 due to new urbanization initiatives, with grayness and crowding rates slowing, while openness increased. The incorporation of UL3D indicators significantly enhances the explanatory power of the regression model for predicting socioeconomic profiles. Specifically, GDP per capita, urban population rate, built-up area per capita, and hospital count correspond to improvements of 25.0%, 19.8%, 35.5%, and 19.2%, respectively. These findings indicate that UL3D indicators have the potential to reflect the socioeconomic profiles of cities. © 2024 Science China Press",Deep learning; Landscape pattern; Street view images; Three-dimensional landscape indicators,Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Comprehensive assessment; Deep learning; Landscape indicators; Landscape pattern; Per capita; Socio-economics; Street view image; Three-dimensional landscape indicator; Two-dimensional; Urban landscape,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFF1303101); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC",This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFF1303101).,"Liu, Yansui, Regularity of rural settlement changes driven by rapid urbanization in North China over the three decades, Science Bulletin, 68, 18, pp. 2115-2124, (2023); Ye, Chao, Rural-urban co-governance: multi-scale practice, Science Bulletin, 65, 10, pp. 778-780, (2020); Wu, Shengbiao, Improved human greenspace exposure equality during 21st century urbanization, Nature Communications, 14, 1, (2023); Leng, Song, Diverse types of coupling trends in urban tree and nontree vegetation associated with urbanization levels, npj Urban Sustainability, 3, 1, (2023); Ye, Chao, The historical logics and geographical patterns of rural-urban governance in China, Journal of Geographical Sciences, 32, 7, pp. 1225-1240, (2022); Huang, Jinchuan, Spatiotemporal characteristics and driving mechanism of the coupling coordination degree of urbanization and ecological environment in Kazakhstan, Journal of Geographical Sciences, 30, 11, pp. 1802-1824, (2020); Lu, Yutian, An approach to urban landscape character assessment: Linking urban big data and machine learning, Sustainable Cities and Society, 83, (2022); Bai, Xuemei, Landscape urbanization and economic growth in China: Positive feedbacks and sustainability dilemmas, Environmental Science and Technology, 46, 1, pp. 132-139, (2012); Fan, Zhuangyuan, Urban visual intelligence: Uncovering hidden city profiles with street view images, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 120, 27, (2023); Salvati, Luca, Do spatial patterns of urbanization and land consumption reflect different socioeconomic contexts in Europe?, Science of the Total Environment, 625, pp. 722-730, (2018)","R.

This study proposes a deep learning model to classify 15-cm aerial imagery of urban landscapes, coupled with a vector-oriented post-classification processing algorithm for automatically retrieving canopy-covered impervious surfaces. In a case study in Corpus Christi, TX, deep learning classification covered an area of approximately 312 km2 (or 14.86 billion 0.15-m pixels), and the post-classification effort led to the retrieval of over 4 km2 (or 0.18 billion pixels) of additional impervious area. The results also suggest the underestimation of urban impervious area by existing methods that cannot consider the canopy-covered impervious surfaces. By improving the identification and quantification of various impervious surfaces at the city scale, this study could directly benefit a variety of environmental and infrastructure management practices and enhance the reliability and accuracy of processed-based models for urban hydrology and water infrastructure. © 2024 The Author(s).

This present study focuses on the Lixia District of Jinan City. By using urban street view big data and deep learning methods, we undertook a detailed analysis of the impacts of urban color features on residents’ emotional perceptions. In particular, a substantial corpus of street scene image data was extracted and processed. This was performed using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and semantic segmentation technology (PSPNet), which enabled the simulation and prediction of the subjective perception of the urban environment by humans. Furthermore, the color complexity and coordination in the street scene were quantified and combined with residents’ emotional feedback to carry out a multi-dimensional analysis. The findings revealed that color complexity and coordination were significant elements influencing residents’ emotional perceptions. A high color complexity is visually appealing, but can lead to fatigue, discomfort, and boredom; a moderate complexity stimulates vitality and pleasure; high levels of regional harmony and aesthetics can increase perceptions of beauty and security; and low levels of coordination can increase feelings of depression. The environmental characteristics of different areas and differences in the daily activities of residents resulted in regional differences regarding the impacts of color features on emotional perception. This study corroborates the assertion that environmental color coordination has the capacity to enhance residents’ emotions, thereby providing an important reference point for urban planning. Planning should be based on the functional characteristics of the region, and color complexity and coordination should be reasonably regulated to optimize the emotional experiences of residents. Differentiated color management enhances urban aesthetics, livability, and residents’ happiness and promotes sustainable development. In the future, the influences of color and environmental factors on emotions can be explored in depth, with a view to assist in the formulation of fine urban design. © 2024 by the authors.",color features; deep convolutional neural network; emotion perception; random forest; urban streetscape,Color vision; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Emotion Recognition; Semantic Segmentation; Color complexity; Color coordination; Color features; Colour perception; Convolutional neural network; Emotion perception; Random forests; Urban colours; Urban environments; Urban streetscape; Convolutional neural networks,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41801308); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41801308.","Chen, Chongxian, Predicting the effect of street environment on residents' mood states in large urban areas using machine learning and street view images, Science of the Total Environment, 816, (2022); Beenackers, Mariëlle A., Urban densification in the Netherlands and its impact on mental health: An expert-based causal loop diagram, Health and Place, 87, (2024); Ma, Xiangyuan, Measuring human perceptions of streetscapes to better inform urban renewal: A perspective of scene semantic parsing, Cities, 110, (2021); Ieri Procedia, (2014); Ding, Meichen, Quantitative contrast of urban agglomeration colors based on image clustering algorithm: Case study of the Xia-Zhang-Quan metropolitan area, Frontiers of Architectural Research, 10, 3, pp. 692-700, (2021); Rui, Quanquan, Quantifying the spatial quality of urban streets with open street view images: A case study of the main urban area of Fuzhou, Ecological Indicators, 156, (2023); Rang, Wei, A unified hybrid memory system for scalable deep learning and big data applications, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 186, (2024); Fu, Leiming, An innovative decision making method for air quality monitoring based on big data-assisted artificial intelligence technique, Journal of Innovation and Knowledge, 8, 2, (2023); Lindal, Pall J., Architectural variation, building height, and the restorative quality of urban residential streetscapes, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 33, pp. 26-36, (2013); Subiza-Pérez, Mikel, Green and blue settings as providers of mental health ecosystem services: Comparing urban beaches and parks and building a predictive model of psychological restoration, Landscape and Urban Planning, 204, (2020)","P.

Previous studies have been limited in regard to the large-scale spatial identification of RPs due to the vagueness of boundaries and the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools. Furthermore, human perception of these places remains unclear. To address this gap, this research adopts a novel approach to identify and evaluate the RPs of a city from the perspective of human perception. Our methodology involves the utilization of deep learning systems, text semantic analysis, and other techniques to integrate multi-source data, including points of interest (POIs), street view images, and social media data. Taking Nanjing, China, as a case, we identified 192 RPs and their perceptual ranges (PRRPs). The results show the following: (1) Comparing RPs to non-RPs, RPs show higher average scores across four perceptual dimensions (positive indicators): Beautiful (7.11% higher), Lively (34.23% higher), Safety (28.42% higher), and Wealthy (28.26% higher). Conversely, RPs exhibit lower average scores in two perceptual dimensions (negative indicators): Boring (79.04% lower) and Depressing (20.35% lower). (2) Across various perceptual dimensions, RPs have utilized 15.13% of the land area to effectively cover approximately 50% of human perceptual hotspots and cold spots. (3) The RPs exhibit significant variations across different types, levels, and human preferences. These results demonstrate the positive perceived effects that RPs have, providing valuable insights to support urban management, the transformation of the built environment, and the promotion of sustainable urban development, and provide guidance for urban planners and designers to make improvements in urban design and planning to make these sites more attractive. © 2024 by the authors.",human perception; identification and evaluation; points of interest; Representative places (RPs); social media check-ins; street view images,identification method; image; machine learning; perception; social media; spatial analysis,,,,,"(SJCX23_0032); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51978144, 52378046); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was financially supported by Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. SJCX23_0032) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51978144, 52378046).

The study investigates how AI-driven urban planning tools can be applied to create more sustainable, efficient, and functional urban environments. PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> show high concentrations with peaks between 2014 and 2017, indicating simple pollution actions. Post-2017, there is a noticeable decline in pollution levels, possibly due to improved regulations or the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific years, like 2016, show extreme spikes, possibly due to industrial activities or natural events. The overall trend suggests improved air quality and moderate to strong positive correlations exist between PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf>, NO<inf>2</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, and CO, indicating shared bases or co-occurrence. However, there is no significant correlation between PM<inf>2.5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf>, suggesting different bases and behaviors. Bi-directional causality is observed between PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and SO<inf>2</inf>, and PM<inf>2.5</inf> and CO. This mutual cause suggests interrelated impressive processes and shared bases. The results of the causality analysis suggest the existence of complex interactions, where high levels of pollution can predict changes in others.

Deep learning models have the potential to significantly speed up wind field prediction. This work introduces a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach based on the U-Net architecture, to rapidly predict wind in simplified urban environments, representative of early-stage design. The process of generating a wind field prediction at pedestrian level is reformulated from a 3D CFD simulation into a 2D image-to-image translation task, using the projected building heights as input. Testing on standard consumer hardware shows that our model can efficiently predict wind velocities in urban settings in less than 1 ms. Further tests on different configurations of the model, combined with a Pareto front analysis, helped identify the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. The fastest configuration is close to seven times faster, while having a relative loss, which is 1.8 times higher than the most accurate configuration. This CNN-based approach provides a fast and efficient method for pedestrian wind comfort (PWC) analysis, potentially aiding in more efficient urban design processes. © 2024 The Author(s).

Residents’ satisfaction with the current urban environment is closely related to the landscape characteristics of the towns surrounding the historic center of Macau. This study aims to analyze the relationship between landscape characteristics and residents’ satisfaction, determine the key factors affecting their satisfaction and how they are combined, and provide a scientific basis for urban planning. This study used a decision tree machine learning model to analyze 524 questionnaire survey responses that addressed five aspects of the historic town’s landscape: the architectural, Largo Square, street, mountain and sea, and commercial landscapes. The data-driven approach helped find the best decision path. The results indicate that (1) the layout of Largo Square, the commercial colors and materials, the location of the former humanities and religion center, and the commercial signage system are the primary factors influencing residents’ satisfaction. (2) Incorporating decision tree parameters with information entropy as the splitting criterion and a minimum sample split number of two (with no maximum depth) led to the best performance when investigating residents’ satisfaction with Macau’s historic town landscape characteristics. (3) A reasonable layout for Largo Square (satisfaction > 3.50), prominent and harmonious commercial colors and materials (satisfaction > 3.50), rich cultural and religious elements (satisfaction > 4.50), and an excellent commercial signage system (satisfaction > 4.00) can significantly improve residents’ satisfaction. This provides important empirical support and a reference for urban planning and landscape design in Macau and other historical and cultural cities. © 2024 by the authors.",decision tree; historic built environment; historic urban landscape; machine learning; satisfaction questionnaire analysis; townscape characteristics; world heritage,Decision trees; Historic preservation; Urban planning; Built environment; Historic build environment; Historic centres; Historic urban landscape; Landscape characteristic; Machine-learning; Satisfaction questionnaire analyze; Townscape characteristic; Urban landscape; World heritage; Adversarial machine learning,,,,,,,"Zandonai, Sheyla S., The portuguese calçada in macau: Paving residual colonialism with a new cultural history of place, Current Anthropology, 59, 4, pp. 378-396, (2018); Mirror of Modernity the Post War Revolution in Urban Conservation, (2009); Vong, Tze Ngai Louis, Exploring Critical Factors of Macau's Heritage Tourism: What Heritage Tourists are Looking for when Visiting the City's Iconic Heritage Sites, Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research, 17, 3, pp. 231-245, (2012); Journal of Current Chinese Affairs, (2009); Bandarin, Francesco, The Historic Urban Landscape: Managing Heritage in an Urban Century, (2012); Asian Geographer, (2010); Asian Affairs, (1993); Chu, Cecilia L., Spectacular Macau: Visioning futures for a World Heritage City, Geoforum, 65, pp. 440-450, (2015); Porter, Jonathan, The past is present"":The construction of macau's historical legacy, History and Memory, 21, 1, pp. 63-100, (2009); Romanian Journal of Comparative Law, (2017)","Y.

Previous studies have mostly focused on the two-dimensional level of urban socio-economic activities, urban land use changes, and urban morphology, neglecting the importance of the three-dimensional spatial structure of cities.

By using urban building data and carbon emission datasets, four machine learning algorithms, BP, RF, CNN, and CNN-RF, are established to build a CO<inf>2</inf> emission prediction model based on three-dimensional spatial structure, and the main influencing factors are further studied. The results show that the CNN-RF model performed optimally in both the testing and validation phases, with the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 0.85, 0.82; 10.60, 22.32; and 2.53, 1.92, respectively. Meanwhile, in the study unit, S, V, NHB, AN, BCR, SCD, and FAR have a greater impact on CO<inf>2</inf> emissions.

Compared to standard computer vision, satellite imagery is unique as images sampled from the data form a continuous array, rather than being fully independent. We argue that the spatial configuration of the images is as important as the content of each image when attempting to capture a pattern that reflects the structure of the urban environment. We propose a series of approaches explicitly incorporating spatial dimension in the predictive pipeline based on the EfficientNetB4 convolutional neural network (CNN) and experimentally test their effect on model performance. The experiments in this study cover the scale of the sampled area, the effect of spatial augmentation, and the role of modelling (logit ensemble and histogram-based gradient-boosted classifiers) with and without the spatial context on the outputs of the neural network-generated vector of probabilities while trying to predict spatial signatures, a classification of primarily urban landscape based on form and function. The results suggest that certain ways of embedding spatial information, especially in the modelling step, consistently significantly improve the prediction accuracy and shall be considered on top of standard CNNs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Classification; Open data; Remote sensing; Spatial signatures,Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Large datasets; Open Data; Satellite imagery; Convolutional neural network; Open datum; Remote-sensing; Spatial configuration; Spatial dimension; Spatial signature; Spatially explicit; Urban environments; Urban form; Urban landscape; Remote sensing; accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; classification; histogram; landscape structure; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial analysis; urban area,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/T005238/1)","The authors kindly acknowledge funding by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council through the project \u201CLearning an urban grammar from satellite data through AI\u201D, project reference ES/T005238/1.","Arribas-Bel, Daniel, Understanding (urban) spaces through form and function, Habitat International, 128, (2022); Brown, Christopher F., Dynamic World, Near real-time global 10 m land use land cover mapping, Scientific Data, 9, 1, (2022); Spatial Processes Models and Applications, (1981); Cohen, Jacob, A Coefficient of Agreement for Nominal Scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 1, pp. 37-46, (1960); Corbane, Christina, A global cloud free pixel- based image composite from Sentinel-2 data, Data in Brief, 31, (2020); Deng, Jia, ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database, pp. 248-255, (2009); undefined, (1990); Europe, (2021); Fleischmann, Martin, Geographical characterisation of British urban form and function using the spatial signatures framework, Scientific Data, 9, 1, (2022); Izzo, Stefano, Classification of urban functional zones through deep learning, Neural Computing and Applications, 34, 9, pp. 6973-6990, (2022)","M.

Here, we introduce a novel 3D Urban Growth Model (3D-UGM) that uniquely integrates vertical structural data, enabling enhanced analysis and prediction of urban development patterns. Our model employs an innovative blend of analytical techniques and scenario-based forecasting, setting a new standard in the field. We report that our horizontal urban growth simulations yield a cell-level mean Kappa value of 0.607 and a pattern-level agreement of 88 %. Additionally, our vertical growth predictions, informed by random forest algorithms, achieve a testing R2 of 0.909 and an average Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.239. Projecting future urban growth under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), our model forecasts a potential increase of up to 20 % in vertical development under SSP3 compared to SSP1. These projections offer a detailed glimpse into the diverse potential urban landscapes under differing environmental and economic scenarios. Our research makes a critical contribution to urban planning literature, providing a robust, data-driven foundation that informs sustainable development strategies, crucial for managing the complexities of vertical growth in rapidly urbanizing areas worldwide. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Random forest; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Urban three-dimensional simulation; Urban vertical growth,3D modeling; Forecasting; Forestry; Mean square error; Sustainable development; Multi-model ensemble; Random forests; Shared socioeconomic pathway; Socio-economics; Three dimensional simulations; Urban development; Urban growth modeling; Urban three-dimensional simulation; Urban vertical growth; Vertical growth; Urban growth; algorithm; growth modeling; machine learning; sustainable development; three-dimensional modeling; urban development; urban growth; urbanization; China; Hubei; Wuhan,,,,,,,"Aliaga, Daniel G., Visualization-based decision tool for urban meteorological modeling, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 40, 2, pp. 271-288, (2013); Batty, Michael J., From cells to cities, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 21, Celebration Issue, pp. 531-548, (1994); Benguigui, Lucien Gilles, Modeling cities in 3D: A cellular automaton approach, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 35, 3, pp. 413-430, (2008); Chen, Bin, Contrasting inequality in human exposure to greenspace between cities of Global North and Global South, Nature Communications, 13, 1, (2022); Chen, Guangzhao, Global projections of future urban land expansion under shared socioeconomic pathways, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Chen, Xuanchi, Enhanced urban growth modelling: Incorporating regional development heterogeneity and noise reduction in a cellular automata model - a case study of Zhengzhou, China, Sustainable Cities and Society, 99, (2023); Chen, Yimin, Delineating urban functional areas with building-level social media data: A dynamic time warping (DTW) distance based k-medoids method, Landscape and Urban Planning, 160, pp. 48-60, (2017); Chen, Yimin, An extended patch-based cellular automaton to simulate horizontal and vertical urban growth under the shared socioeconomic pathways, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 91, (2022); Clarke, Keith C., Loose-coupling a cellular automaton model and GIS: Long-term urban growth prediction for San Francisco and Washington/Baltimore, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 12, 7, pp. 699-714, (1998); Esch, Thomas, World Settlement Footprint 3D - A first three-dimensional survey of the global building stock, Remote Sensing of Environment, 270, (2022)","R.

The sensitivity of water transparency to nine water quality parameters, including chlorophyll a and inorganic suspended solids, in 16 urban landscape lakes of the city of Taiyuan was evaluated using the Sobol and Morris sensitivity analysis methods. The results indicate that for water bodies supplied by surface water, critical factors include chlorophyll a and hydraulic retention time. For water bodies supplied by tap water, inorganic suspended solids and total phosphorus are more significant. Water bodies with a dual function of urban flood control should focus on dissolved oxygen, ammonium nitrogen, and chemical oxygen demand.

As the seventh-leading cause of death in Canada, suicide necessitates targeted prevention strategies, especially in areas with lower suicide rates such as Ontario. To explore spatial patterns of suicide attempts and intentional self-inflicted injuries, individual-level data is collected and generalized to the census tract for rigorous spatial analyses. Self-Organizing Maps are utilized to build distinct regional clusters based on shared characteristics. These clusters unveil diverse combinations of suicide counts, religious affiliations, income levels, education levels, and immigrant populations, providing comprehensive insights into the multicultural composition of the area. The study findings reveal specific spatial patterns of suicide attempts associated with particular religious affiliations, shedding new light on the influence of faith and spirituality on mental health outcomes within the context of suicide prevention. The analysis underscores the importance of a nuanced understanding of these factors to guide effective suicide prevention interventions. Considering the spatial distribution of religious affiliations and suicide rates, this study offers valuable guidance for targeted and culturally sensitive suicide prevention efforts in the Greater Golden Horseshoe region and other similar urban landscapes. The implications of this research extend to the broader mental health field and emphasize the significance of accounting for sociocultural dimensions in devising evidence-based interventions to mitigate suicide effectively. © 2024",Canada; Public health policy; Socioeconomic factors; Spatial analysis; Toronto; Urban planning,health policy; machine learning; public health; religion; self organizing map; spatial analysis; suicide; urban planning; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto,,,,,,,"Chesin, Megan S., Risk assessment and psychosocial interventions for suicidal patients., Bipolar Disorders, 15, 5, pp. 584-593, (2013); Cunsolo Willox, Ashlee J.L., Climate change and mental health: An exploratory case study from Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Canada, Climatic Change, 121, 2, pp. 255-270, (2013); American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, (2003); Gratz, Kim L., Risk factors for and functions of deliberate self-harm: An empirical and conceptual review, Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 10, 2, pp. 192-205, (2003); Hawton, Keith E., Suicide, The Lancet, 373, 9672, pp. 1372-1381, (2009); Mann, Joseph John, A current perspective of suicide and attempted suicide, Annals of Internal Medicine, 136, 4, pp. 302-311, (2002); undefined; Middleton, Nicos, The geography of despair among 15-44-year-old men in England and Wales: Putting suicide on the map, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 60, 12, pp. 1040-1047, (2006); Milner, Allison Joy, Globalization and Suicide: An Ecological Study Across Five Regions of the World, Archives of Suicide Research, 16, 3, pp. 238-249, (2012); Penfound, Elissa, Analysis of wetland landcover change in great lakes urban areas using self-organizing maps, Remote Sensing, 13, 24, (2021)","E.

This study introduces a multi-task deep learning network with a flexible architecture for simultaneously extracting spatial and attributional building information from high-resolution satellite images. This method efficiently segments rooftops and classifies buildings by urban function and architectural style of rooftops. Moreover, a strategic spatial sampling scheme from a data-centric perspective, informed by geographic and environmental diversity, optimizes the selection of representative samples to improve training efficiency and predictive accuracy. Comparative analyses demonstrate the framework's superior performance, achieving an F1 score of 84.30% and an intersection over union of 72.86% in rooftop segmentation, and Kappa scores of 74.67% and 70.04% in classifying urban functions and architectural types, outperforming other advanced models by 2% to 25% across various metrics. Additionally, the adaptability of the network ensures that the framework meets diverse accuracy and efficiency requirements. By applying the proposed methodology to Shanghai, a unified city-scale dataset is generated. This dataset underscores the practical applicability and potential influence of the proposed methods in the fields of urban studies and sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Building information extraction; Data-centric approach; Deep learning; High-resolution satellite imagery; Multi-task learning; Spatial sampling,Data mining; Deep learning; Efficiency; Learning systems; Satellite imagery; Sustainable development; Building information extraction; Data-centric approaches; High resolution satellite imagery; Large-scales; Multitask learning; Simultaneous extractions; Spatial sampling; Urban dynamics; Urban landscape; Buildings; architectural design; building; data set; machine learning; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; urban development,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42325107, 42101353, 41930648); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (21YJC790129); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42325107 ), in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42101353 ), and in part by the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (General Program) (No. 21YJC790129 ).; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41930648), in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42325107), in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42101353), and in part by the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (General Program) (No. 21YJC790129).","Almeida, Cláudia Peres, Sustainability assessment of building rehabilitation actions in old urban centres, Sustainable Cities and Society, 36, pp. 378-385, (2018); Altomonte, Sergio, Ten questions concerning well-being in the built environment, Building and Environment, 180, (2020); Assouline, Dan, Quantifying rooftop photovoltaic solar energy potential: A machine learning approach, Solar Energy, 141, pp. 278-296, (2017); Berko, Andrii Y., A Method to Solve Uncertainty Problem for Big Data Sources, pp. 32-37, (2018); Bertsimas, Dimitris J., Simulated annealing, Statistical Science, 8, 1, pp. 10-15, (1993); Cao, Yue, Ensemble deep learning in bioinformatics, Nature Machine Intelligence, 2, 9, pp. 500-508, (2020); Cao, Duanguang, A stacking ensemble deep learning model for building extraction from remote sensing images, Remote Sensing, 13, 19, (2021); Chen, Yixing, Development of city buildings dataset for urban building energy modeling, Energy and Buildings, 183, pp. 252-265, (2019); Chen, Tingting, Identifying urban spatial structure and urban vibrancy in highly dense cities using georeferenced social media data, Habitat International, 89, (2019); undefined, (2019)","M.

Given the significant impact of land shape on architectural and urban planning outcomes, its analysis is essential. However, studies on land shape have been limited due to the lack of definitive survey criteria. To address these challenges, this study utilized a map application programming interface (API) to gather raw data on apartment complex layouts in South Korea and processed these images using a Python-based image library. An initial analysis involved categorizing the data through K-means clustering. Each cluster’s average image was classified into four distinct groups for comparison with the existing literature. Shape indices were employed to analyze land configurations and assess consistency across classes. These classes were annotated on a parcel level using the Roboflow API, and YOLOv8s-cls was developed to classify the parcels effectively. The evaluation of this model involved calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score from a confusion matrix. The results show a strong correlation between the identified and established classes, with the YOLO model achieving an accuracy of 86% and demonstrating robust prediction capabilities across classes. This confirms the effective typification of land shapes in the studied apartment complexes. This study introduces a methodology for analyzing parcel shapes through machine learning and deep learning. It asserts that this approach transcends the confines of South Korean apartment complexes, extending its applicability to architectural and urban design planning on a global scale. Analyzing land shapes earmarked for construction enables the formulation of diverse design strategies for building placement and external space arrangement. This highlights the potential for innovative design approaches in architectural and urban planning worldwide. © 2024 by the authors.",apartment complex; deep learning; image classification; machine learning; YOLOv8,Apartment houses; Application programming interfaces (API); Architectural design; Deep learning; K-means clustering; Land use; Learning systems; Python; Urban planning; Apartment complexes; Applications programming interfaces; Image library; Images classification; Land parcels; Learning techniques; Machine-learning; South Korea; YOLOv8; Image classification,,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Hyupsung University, UHS",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.RS-2022-0016605712482147660003) and the Hyupsung University Research Grant of 2024).,"J Urban Des Inst Korea, (2009); Master Thesis, (2016); Journal of Real Estate Analysis, (2017); Guidelines for Investigation and Calculation of Individual Official Land Price Applied in 2023, (2023); Self Studying Machine Learning Deep Learning, (2020); Journal of the Korean Cartographic Association, (2017); Fragstats Spatial Pattern Analysis Program for Quantifying Landscape Structure, (1995); A Study on Improvement of Land Characteristic Survey, (2015); Demetriou, Demetris, A parcel shape index for use in land consolidation planning, Transactions in GIS, 17, 6, pp. 861-882, (2013); Lee, Ju-mi, Comparison of models to forecast real estates index introducing machine learning, Journal of the Architectural Institute of Korea, 37, 1, pp. 191-199, (2021)","S.-E.

Hence, the visual coherence of buildings (VCoB) plays a crucial role in such areas, not only pertaining to the visual quality of the urban landscape but also regarding the preservation of historic features. The accurate measurement of the VCoB is a prerequisite for undertaking optimization efforts. However, discussions of the VCoB in the built environment are limited and seldom address residential historic areas, and methods for measuring the VCoB have yet to be refined. Therefore, taking the Xiaoxihu Historic Area in Nanjing as a case study, this work aimed to develop a more refined method for measuring the VCoB in residential historic areas based on objective physical features. The method is mainly based on the human-level perspective, identifying three key visual elements within this perspective as the objects of measurement. It collected visual data through photography, with deep learning and computer graphics processing tools being utilized to identify and extract the visual elements. Then, the study established a corresponding framework of indicators for different visual elements and optimizes the methods for indicator calculation. Through an assessment involving professionals, we validated the high accuracy of the measurement method proposed in this study. Furthermore, the study discusses factors affecting the VCoB, methods to enhance the VCoB, and the required degree of the VCoB based on the results of the measurement. The method developed in this research will provide support for the visual analysis of the urban built environment and urban renewal practices. © 2024 by the authors.",buildings; historic residential areas; measurement method; visual coherence,Computer graphics; Historic preservation; Housing; Built environment; Case-studies; Historic residential area; Measurement methods; Nanjing; Residential areas; Residential building; Urban renewal; Visual coherence; Visual elements; Deep learning,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52278009); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",This research received funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52278009).,"Carmon, Naomi, Three generations of urban renewal policies: analysis and policy implications, Geoforum, 30, 2, pp. 145-158, (1999); Zheng, Wei Wei, A review of recent studies on sustainable urban renewal, Habitat International, 41, pp. 272-279, (2014); Wang, Hao, The Relationship Between Urban Renewal and the Built Environment: A Systematic Review and Bibliometric Analysis, Journal of Planning Literature, 37, 2, pp. 293-308, (2022); Couch, Chris, Thirty years of urban regeneration in Britain, Germany and France: The importance of context and path dependency, Progress in Planning, 75, 1, pp. 1-52, (2011); Historic Environment Policy Practice, (2013); Procedia Soc Behav Sci, (2016); Spennemann, Dirk H.R., What Actually Is a Heritage Conservation Area?

Meso-scale cities are the most developed cities in China and play an important role in economic and social development. The current robot technology is mainly divided into industrial robots and service robots, which can play an important role in the development of cities. This paper aims to apply AI robotics technology to the analysis and intelligent management of mesoscale urban design genealogy. Firstly, the development pedigree of the mesoscale city was analyzed, from which the characteristics of previous designs could be clearly understood. Then, the urban management and control system is intelligently designed from many aspects, the characteristics of the robot are analyzed, and the application of the intelligent robot in urban design is introduced. After that, four developing meso‑scale cities in a province were selected as the evaluation objects, and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was proposed to evaluate the application effect of robotics technology in meso‑scale cities. The results showed that the overall score of the robot in urban traffic design was greater than 70 points, and the overall score of urban architectural design was greater than 65 points, which was in the acceptable range. In the application score of urban environment design, the influence was about 70 to 80 points, and the aesthetics was more than 75 points. The cultural aspect of the design impact score was no more than 75 points, while the cultural support aspect score was around 80 points. After the weight calculation, the final overall score was 489 points, and the comprehensive average score was 36 points. The overall composite score and average score were both good. This showed that the application of robot technology to the pedigree analysis and intelligent management and control of mesoscale urban design could achieve good results. © 2024",Analytic hierarchy process; Intelligent management and control; Medium-scale urban design; Pedigree analysis; Robot technology,Economic and social effects; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Machine design; Process control; Intelligent management; Intelligent management and control; Management and controls; Medium-scale; Medium-scale urban design; Meso scale; Pedigree analysis; Robot technology; Urban design; Urban management; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,,,"Aksoy, Ercüment, Geographical information systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) integration for sustainable landfill site selection considering dynamic data source, Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment, 78, 2, pp. 779-791, (2019); Basdeki, Aikaterini, Design, calculations and performance evaluation of rain gardens in an urban neighborhood of Thessaloniki, Greece, Desalination and Water Treatment, 99, pp. 4-9, (2017); Bertelsen, Ann Sophia, Use of robot technology in passive mobilization of acute hospitalized geriatric medicine patients: A pilot test and feasibility study, Pilot and Feasibility Studies, 6, 1, (2020); Đorđević, Vladimir, Data-driven control of hydraulic servo actuator: An event-triggered adaptive dynamic programming approach, Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, 20, 5, pp. 8561-8582, (2023); Esfandeh, Sorour, Climate change risk of urban growth and land use/land cover conversion: An in‐depth review of the recent research in Iran, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 1, (2022); Chemical Technology Control and Management, (2018); Habibzadeh, Hadi, Smart city system design: A comprehensive study of the application and data planes, ACM Computing Surveys, 52, 2, (2020); Hwang, Kitae, Performance Monitoring of MQTT-based Messaging Server and System, Journal of Logistics, Informatics and Service Science, 9, 1, pp. 85-96, (2022); Kamal, Elkhatib, Intelligent Energy Management Strategy Based on Artificial Neural Fuzzy for Hybrid Vehicle, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, 3, 1, pp. 112-125, (2018); Kim, Kyuwon, Design of integrated risk management-based dynamic driving control of automated vehicles, IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine, 9, 1, pp. 57-73, (2017)",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,26673053,,,,English,Intell.

South America's urban development and trees are closely interconnected, and tree cover within cities plays a vital role in shaping sustainable and resilient urban landscapes. However, knowledge of urban tree canopy (UTC) coverage in the South American continent remains limited. In this study, we used high-resolution satellite images and developed a semi-supervised deep learning method to create UTC data for 888 South American cities. The proposed semi-supervised method can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data during training. By incorporating labeled data for guidance and utilizing unlabeled data to explore underlying patterns, the algorithm enhances model robustness and generalization for urban tree canopy detection across South America, with an average overall accuracy of 94.88% for the tested cities. Based on the created UTC products, we successfully assessed the UTC coverage for each city. Statistical results showed that the UTC coverage in South America is between 0.76% and 69.53%, and the average UTC coverage is approximately 19.99%. Among the 888 cities, only 357 cities that accommodate approximately 48.25% of the total population have UTC coverage greater than 20%, while the remaining 531 cities that accommodate approximately 51.75% of the total population have UTC coverage less than 20%. Natural factors (climatic and geographical) play a very important role in determining UTC coverage, followed by human activity factors (economy and urbanization level). We expect that the findings of this study and the created UTC dataset will help formulate policies and strategies to promote sustainable urban forestry, thus further improving the quality of life of residents in South America. © 2024 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Remote sensing; South America; Urban sustainable development; Urban tree canopy,Deep learning; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Supervised learning; Urban growth; Canopy coverage; Fine-scale; High resolution satellite images; Remote-sensing; South America; Urban development; Urban sustainable development; Urban tree canopies; Urban trees; Remote sensing; canopy; image resolution; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sustainable development; tree; urban development,,,,,"Munich Center for Machine Learning, MCML; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01DD20001); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi, (50EE2201C); Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by part by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the international future AI Laboratory \u201CAI4EO-Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation: Reasoning, Uncertainties, Ethics and Beyond\u201D under Grant 01DD20001, in part by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology in the framework of the \u201CNational Center of excellence ML4Earth\u201D under Grant 50EE2201C, and in part by the Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the L\u00E4nder through the TUM Innovation Network EarthCare and by Munich Center for Machine Learning.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by part by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the international future AI Laboratory \u201CAI4EO-Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation: Reasoning, Uncertainties, Ethics and Beyond\u201D under Grant 01DD20001 , and in part by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology in the framework of the \u201CNational Center of excellence ML4Earth\u201D under Grant 50EE2201C .","Aval, Josselin, Object-based fusion for urban tree species classification from hyperspectral, panchromatic and nDSM data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 40, 14, pp. 5339-5365, (2019); Banzhaf, Ellen, Monitoring the urban tree cover for urban ecosystem services -The case of Leipzig, Germany, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 40, 7W3, pp. 301-305, (2015); Ordóñez-Barona, Camilo, Trends in Urban Forestry Research in Latin America & The Caribbean: A Systematic Literature Review and Synthesis, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 47, (2020); Nooraei Beidokhti, Alireza, The effects of precipitation, tree phenology, leaf area index, and bark characteristics on throughfall rates by urban trees: A meta-data analysis, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 60, (2021); Bengio, Yoshua, Practical recommendations for gradient-based training of deep architectures, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7700 LECTURE NO, pp. 437-478, (2012); Environ Dev Sustain, (2022); Bolyn, Corentin, Mapping tree species proportions from satellite imagery using spectral–spatial deep learning, Remote Sensing of Environment, 280, (2022); Brandt, Martin Stefan, Reduction of tree cover in West African woodlands and promotion in semi-arid farmlands, Nature Geoscience, 11, 5, pp. 328-333, (2018); Brandt, Martin Stefan, An unexpectedly large count of trees in the West African Sahara and Sahel, Nature, 587, 7832, pp. 78-82, (2020); Breger, Benjamin S., Urban tree survival and stewardship in a state-managed planting initiative: A case study in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 43, (2019)","J.

Past studies, however, have primarily concentrated on regional and urban scales. The complexities of human-environment interactions necessitate a more fine-grained measure of urban morphology beyond two-dimensional spaces. This study delves into the intricacies of horizontal and vertical urban surfaces within community life circles. It examines human-scale landscapes using a bottom-up metric system that includes eye-level quality, road network design, buildings and functions, and neighborhood location. The methods of deep learning and street view images are utilized to evaluate the eye-level morphology. The study then analyzes the heterogeneous impacts and interaction effects of morphological variables on urban vitality at the community life circle level through multiscale geographic weighted regression and geographical detector model. The findings reveal a core-periphery structure and strong spatial autocorrelations between the morphological variables and urban vitality. Furthermore, the determinants of urban vitality exhibit a blend of global, regional, and local spatial contexts. The human-observed greenery, sky openness, and public bus accessibility demonstrate significant spatial heterogeneity linked to local vitality, whereas street betweenness and commercial facilities exhibit limited effects. The interaction effects between morphological variables can either enhance or weaken their individual impacts, highlighting the need for community life circle planning that considers the combined effects of these variables.

As an important criterion for residents' social interaction and mobility vigor, collective walking describes the results of walking activities in streets and positively correlates with the built environments. However, limited attention has been given to the contribution of built environment factors in peri-urban areas towards promoting collective walking. Therefore, this study employed multisource data to assess the impact of these factors on collective walking in peri-urban areas. Our analysis delved into the impact of these factors on collective walking across various urban spaces and explored intervention effects through cross-classification studies that prioritize planning strategies. These results revealed that (1) The impacts of the built environment on collective walking behavior differs in peri-urban areas. (2) Diversity and distance only show significant impacts in peri-urban areas. (3) A distinct spatial mismatch between urban spatial form and collective walking behavior is observed. Subsequent urban design interventions should consider these spatial distribution differences for prioritized zoning planning. Our findings provided convincing evidence that delineated the impact of built environments in peri-urban areas that can guide government and planners to precisely design pedestrian environments through targeted intervention measures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Collective walking behavior; Machine learning; Peri-urban area; Street view image,GIS; periurban area; residential mobility; satellite imagery; spatial distribution; travel behavior; urban design; walking; zoning policy; Chengdu; China; Sichuan,,,,,,,"Abenoza, Roberto F., What is the role of weather, built-environment and accessibility geographical characteristics in influencing travelers’ experience?, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 122, pp. 34-50, (2019); Ahani, Somayeh, A review of domains, approaches, methods and indicators in peri-urbanization literature, Habitat International, 114, (2021); Amirinejad, Ghazal, Ambiguity at the peri-urban interface in Australia, Land Use Policy, 78, pp. 472-480, (2018); Ao, Yibin, Influences of rural built environment on travel mode choice of rural residents: The case of rural Sichuan, Journal of Transport Geography, 85, (2020); Asfandiyarova, L.

With the increase in heavy precipitations, the ability to proactively identify flash floods hotspots in cities is critical for flood nowcasting and predictive monitoring of risks. While rainfall runoff models and hydrologic models are useful models for flash flood prediction, these models are computationally expensive and effort intensive to be used for flood nowcasting. To address this challenge, this study presents interpretable machine learning models for predicting urban flash flood hotspots based on intertwined land and built environment features. The task of predicting flash flood hotspots is formulated as a binary classification problem, and three recent flash flood events in U.S. cities are selected for data collection and model validation. Various features related to land and built environment characteristics are constructed using diverse datasets, and the occurrences of flash floods are captured using crowdsource data from the events. Using these features and datasets, the flash flood hotspots of cities are predicted with two ensemble models based on decision trees. The results demonstrate that the models can achieve good accuracy (0.8) in identifying flooded/non-flooded locations. Especially, the models can achieve high true positive rate (0.83–0.89) and low missing rate, demonstrating the methods' practicability for accurately predicting flooded hotspots. The model interpretation results indicate that land features related to hydrological and topological features have greater impacts on flash flood risk, than built environment features. Further analysis reveals that the feature importance, model performance, and model transferability performance vary among cities and localized specifications of the models are needed for accurate prediction of flash flood for a particular city. The data-driven machine learning models presented in this study provide a useful tool for predicting flash flood hotspots based on the intertwined features of land and the built environment in cities to enable nowcasting and proactive monitoring of flash flood hotspots for emergency response and also inform integrated urban design and development towards flash flood risk reduction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Crowdsourced data; Flash flood; Machine learning,Crowdsourcing; Decision trees; Forecasting; Machine learning; Built environment; Crowdsourced data; Flash-floods; Hotspots; Land environments; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Nowcasting; Pluvials; Urban areas; Floods; accuracy assessment; data interpretation; flash flood; flood forecasting; machine learning; rainfall-runoff modeling; risk assessment; urban design,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1832662)","The authors would like to acknowledge funding support from the National Science Foundation CRISP 2.0 Type 2 No. 1832662: “Anatomy of Coupled Human-Infrastructure Systems Resilience to Urban Flooding: Integrated Assessment of Social, Institutional, and Physical Networks.” Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this research are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the view of the funding agencies.","Agonafir, Candace, A machine learning approach to evaluate the spatial variability of New York City's 311 street flooding complaints, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 97, (2022); Bagan, Hasi, Analysis of urban growth and estimating population density using satellite images of nighttime lights and land-use and population data, GIScience and Remote Sensing, 52, 6, pp. 765-780, (2015); Bates, Paul D., Uncertainty in flood inundation modelling, pp. 232-269, (2014); Blum, Annalise G., Causal Effect of Impervious Cover on Annual Flood Magnitude for the United States, Geophysical Research Letters, 47, 5, (2020); Bradford, Roisin A., Risk perception - Issues for flood management in Europe, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 12, 7, pp. 2299-2309, (2012); Chiang, Shen, Comparison of Rainfall-Runoff Simulation between Support Vector Regression and HEC-HMS for a Rural Watershed in Taiwan, Water (Switzerland), 14, 2, (2022); Choubin, B., An ensemble prediction of flood susceptibility using multivariate discriminant analysis, classification and regression trees, and support vector machines, Science of the Total Environment, 651, pp. 2087-2096, (2019); undefined, (2022); undefined, (2022); Dong, Shangjia, Predictive multi-watershed flood monitoring using deep learning on integrated physical and social sensors data, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 49, 7, pp. 1838-1856, (2022)","Z.

Employing a novel approach that combines street view data and deep learning technology, the research aims to identify and map the spatial distribution of Tibetan Buddhist spiritual sites against the backdrop of the urban landscape. Our analysis reveals a notable concentration of these spiritual places near urban architectural and cultural heritage areas, highlighting the profound connection between residents' cultural life and spiritual practices. Despite challenges posed by modern urbanisation, these spiritual sites demonstrate resilience and adaptability, continuing to serve as cultural and spiritual pillars of the Tibetan Buddhist community. This study contributes to the fields of urban planning, religious studies, and digital humanities by demonstrating the potential of technology in examining the impact of urban development on cultural and religious landscapes. The research underscores the importance of protecting and integrating spaces of spiritual perception in urban development planning. It shows that safeguarding these spaces is crucial not only for cultural heritage preservation but also for achieving sustainable urban development and social harmony. This study opens new avenues for interdisciplinary research, advocating for a deeper understanding of the dynamic relationship between urban development and spiritual spaces from psychological, sociological, and environmental science perspectives.

With densely built modernist architecture and relatively free building regulations, it is challenging to trace the actual development of the whole city. Compared to European cities, their overall urban landscapes are much denser, higher, and functionally mixed. In order to achieve a quicker and more accurate identification of urban forms in mega-cities, this study proposed a two-level machine-learning approach. At the building level, we extracted features from topographic maps and building licenses to automatically classify building types. Four state-of-the-art multi-class classification models were compared. At the block level, we used building types as input data and compared two methods for block clustering. In total 61,426 buildings from Taipei were classified and grouped into 10 block types. Different from Western cities, many of the block types in Taipei were mixtures of different types of buildings. This approach is efficient in exploring new urban form types, especially for emerging mega-cities where block types are previously unknown. The result not only sheds light on the features of East Asian urban landscapes but also serves as important basis of type-based strategic plans for contemporary urban issues. © The Author(s) 2023.",building classification; clustering; East Asia; machine learning; urban form,building; classification; cluster analysis; machine learning; megacity; urban morphology; Far East,,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the PhD grant by Ministry of Education, Taiwan.","Tensorflow Large Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, (2015); Araldi, Alessandro, From the street to the metropolitan region: Pedestrian perspective in urban fabric analysis, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 46, 7, pp. 1243-1263, (2019); Arundel, Rowan, The role of urban form in sustainability of community: The case of Amsterdam, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 44, 1, pp. 33-53, (2017); Bai, Yingjiu, Urban warming and urban heat islands in Taipei, Taiwan, pp. 231-246, (2011); Bard, Sylvain, Quality assessment of cartographic generalisation, Transactions in GIS, 8, 1, pp. 63-81, (2004); Beck, Anthony, Automated classification metrics for energy modelling of residential buildings in the UK with open algorithms, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 47, 1, pp. 45-64, (2020); Stadtebaulicher Rahmenplan Klimaanpassung Fur Die Stadt Karlsruhe Teil II, (2014); Belgiu, Mariana, Ontology-based classification of building types detected from airborne laser scanning data, Remote Sensing, 6, 2, pp. 1347-1366, (2014); Beyhan, Burak, An algorithm for maximum inscribed circle based on Voronoi diagrams and geometrical properties, Journal of Geographical Systems, 22, 3, pp. 391-418, (2020); Shaping Cities in an Urban Age, (2018)","C.-Y.

However, the definition and measurement of urban vibrancy have not been consistently and clearly followed. With the development of technologies such as big data and machine learning, urban planners have adopted new methods that enable better quantitative evaluation of urban performance. This research attempts to quantify the impact on the urban vibrancy of the urban interventions introduced by the LivingLine project in a residential neighborhood renovation made in Siping Street, Shanghai. We use Wi-Fi probes to process collected mobile phone data and segment people into different categories according to commuting patterns analysis. We use a pre-trained random forest model to determine the specific locations of each person. Subsequently, we analyze the behavior patterns of people from stay points detection and trajectory analysis. Through statistical models, we apply multi-linear regression and find that urban intervention (well-curated and defined lab events deployed in the street) and people’s behavior are positively correlated, which helps us to prove the impact of urban intervention on street dynamics. The research proposes a novel, evidence-based, low-cost methodology for studying granular behavior patterns on a street level without compromising users’ data privacy. © The Author(s) 2023.",behavioral analysis; machine learning; multi-linear regression; Street activities; urban vibrancy; Wi-Fi data,algorithm; commuting; machine learning; neighborhood; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; China; Shanghai,,,,,,,"Barreca, Alice, Urban vibrancy: An emerging factor that spatially influences the real estate market, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 1, (2020); Bellomo, Nicola, Human behaviours in evacuation crowd dynamics: From modelling to “big data” toward crisis management, Physics of Life Reviews, 18, pp. 1-21, (2016); Comput Syst Appl, (2020); Calabrese, Francesco, Eigenplaces: Segmenting space through digital signatures, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 9, 1, pp. 78-84, (2010); Crowd Data Analytics as Seen from Wifi A Critical Review, (2019); Gansner, Emden R., Multilevel agglomerative edge bundling for visualizing large graphs, pp. 187-194, (2011); Griffiths, Ron, Cultural strategies and new modes of urban intervention, Cities, 12, 4, pp. 253-265, (1995); Hu, Xinyu, Using Wi-Fi probe and location data to analyze the human distribution characteristics of green spaces: A case study of the Yanfu Greenland Park, China, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 54, (2020); Huang, Bo, Evaluating and characterizing urban vibrancy using spatial big data: Shanghai as a case study, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 47, 9, pp. 1543-1559, (2020); Death and Life of Great American Cities, (1961)","J.

However, existing assessment methods often lack temporal dynamics or heavily rely on historical big data, limiting their ability to accurately predict outcomes for unbuilt projects. To address these challenges, this study integrates previous methodologies with observations of crowd characteristics in public spaces. It introduces the crowd-frequency hypothesis and develops an algorithm to establish a time-dimensional urban vitality dynamic prediction model. Through a case study of the Rundle Mall neighborhood in Adelaide, Australia, the effectiveness of the prediction model was validated using on-site observation sampling and comparative verification. The prediction model framework allows for the determination of urban vitality within specific time ranges by directly inputting basic information, providing valuable support to urban planners and government officials during the design and decision-making processes. It offers a cost-effective approach to achieve sustainable urban vitality construction. Furthermore, machine learning techniques, specifically the decision tree model, were applied to case data to develop a set of preliminary algorithm tools, which enable output of reference urban vitality levels (high-medium-low). © 2024 by the authors.",algorithm; crowd-frequency; prediction model; urban vitality,algorithm; government; hypothesis testing; neighborhood; numerical model; prediction; public space; Adelaide; Australia; South Australia,,,,,(19FXWB026); (HITSZERP19001); (GXWD20201230155427003-20200822174038001); (400715),"This research was funded by: Later Funded Projects of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China, grant number No. 19FXWB026; Higher Education Research and Reform Project of Guangdong Province (No. HITSZERP19001); General Project of Stabilization Support Program of Shenzhen Universities (No. GXWD20201230155427003-20200822174038001); Key Laboratory of Cognitive and Personality, Ministry of Education, Chongqing, 400715; Shenzhen Education Science \u201C14th Five-Year Plan\u201D 2022 Annual Topic (No.: cgpy22018).","Moser, Sarah, Forest city, Malaysia, and Chinese expansionism, Urban Geography, 39, 6, pp. 935-943, (2018); Shi, Lifeng, Urbanization that hides in the dark – Spotting China's “ghost neighborhoods” from space, Landscape and Urban Planning, 200, (2020); Eur Stud, (2017); Wang, Jian, Driving factors of urban shrinkage: Examining the role of local industrial diversity, Cities, 99, (2020); Yang, Zhenshan, Are cities losing their vitality?

Deep learning techniques tackle urban complexity and diversity, which unlocks a broad range of applications. These include urban planning, transportation management, autonomous driving, and smart city efforts. Through rich context and insights, semantic segmentation helps decision-makers and stakeholders make educated decisions for sustainable and effective urban development. This study investigates an in-depth exploration of cityscape image segmentation using the U-Net deep learning model. The proposed U-Net architecture comprises an encoder and decoder structure. The encoder uses convolutional layers and down sampling to extract hierarchical information from input images. Each down sample step reduces spatial dimensions, and increases feature depth, aiding context acquisition. Batch normalization and dropout layers stabilize models and prevent overfitting during encoding. The decoder reconstructs higher-resolution feature maps using ""UpSampling2D"" layers. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation of the Cityscapes dataset, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the U-Net model in achieving state-of-the-art results in image segmentation.

Employing Beijing, China as the case, this study conducted an empirical analysis of multilevel BE factors affecting outdoor jogging utilizing multi-source big data, including large-scale jogging GPS trajectories and street view images. Results revealed that: (1) Macroscale BE including sports amenities and accessibility play an important role in affecting jogging. (2) All BE factors have nonlinear association with jogging, and the effective range and threshold effects vary by variables. Notably, several variables associated with jogging are in inverted U or V shapes. (3) The complex interaction effects including synergistic, weakened, among BE factors were scrutinized. BE factors regarding accessibility and sports amenity interact more easily. (4) Regions with similar local effects were clustered to understand the spatial varying of BE's influences and establish targeted interventions.

This paper presents a novel framework that integrates street greenery with accessibility, enabling a detailed evaluation of the daily street-level greenery visible to residents. This pioneering approach introduces a new measurement methodology to quantify the quality of urban street greening, providing robust empirical evidence to support its enhancement. This study delves into Nanjing’s five districts, employing advanced image semantic segmentation based on machine learning techniques to segment and extract green vegetation from Baidu Street View (BSV) images. Leveraging spatial syntax, it analyzes street network data sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to quantify the accessibility values of individual streets. Subsequent overlay analyses uncover areas characterized by high accessibility but inadequate street greening, underscoring the pressing need for street greening enhancements in highly accessible zones, thereby providing valuable decision-making support for urban planners. Key findings revealed that (1) the green view index (GVI) of sampled points within the study area ranged from 15.79% to 38.17%, with notably better street greening conditions observed in the Xuanwu District; (2) the Yuhua District exhibited comparatively lower pedestrian and commuting accessibility than the Xuanwu District; and (3) approximately 139.62 km of roads in the study area demonstrated good accessibility but lacked sufficient greenery visibility, necessitating immediate improvements in their green landscapes. This research utilizes the potential of novel data and methodologies, along with their practical applications in planning and design practices. Notably, this study integrates street greenery visibility with accessibility to explore, from a human-centered perspective, the tangible benefits of green landscapes. These insights highlight the opportunity for local governments to advance urban planning and design by implementing more human-centered green space policies, ultimately promoting societal equity. © 2024 by the authors.",accessibility; image semantic segmentation; machine learning; space syntax; street greenery; street view,Decision making; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Syntactics; Urban planning; Visibility; Accessibility; Image semantic segmentation; Image semantics; Machine-learning; Semantic segmentation; Space syntax; Street greenery; Street view; Study areas; Urban streets; Machine learning; accessibility; greenspace; image processing; local government; machine learning; modeling; segmentation; urban design; urban planning; Area; Data; Decision Making; Design; Planning; Quality; Segmentation; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu],,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (23SHC002, BK20201359); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; (2019ZD007)","This research was funded by Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, grant number 23SHC002; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, grant number BK20201359; and Science and Technology Plan Project of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Housing and Urban Rural Development, grant number 2019ZD007.","Soga, Masashi, A room with a green view: the importance of nearby nature for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ecological Applications, 31, 2, (2021); Nutsford, Daniel, An ecological study investigating the association between access to urban green space and mental health, Public Health, 127, 11, pp. 1005-1011, (2013); Liotta, Charlotte, Planning for environmental justice - reducing well-being inequalities through urban greening, Environmental Science and Policy, 112, pp. 47-60, (2020); Williams, Tim G., Parks and safety: a comparative study of green space access and inequity in five US cities, Landscape and Urban Planning, 201, (2020); Pearsall, Hamil, Locating the green space paradox: A study of gentrification and public green space accessibility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Landscape and Urban Planning, 195, (2020); Ishikawa, Noriko, Effects of street landscape planting and urban public parks on dwelling environment evaluation in Japan, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 11, 4, pp. 390-395, (2012); Stessens, Philip, Analysing urban green space accessibility and quality: A GIS-based model as spatial decision support for urban ecosystem services in Brussels, Ecosystem Services, 28, pp. 328-340, (2017); Cetin, M., Using GIS analysis to assess urban green space in terms of accessibility: Case study in Kutahya, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 22, 5, pp. 420-424, (2015); Yang, Jun, Can you see green?

To date, only a few studies have used image analytics and deep learning methods to attempt to estimate these concepts based on a training set of user rated images. We aimed to 1) test whether the use of deep learning could be applied to predict perceptions of beauty, restorativeness, and naturalness in Google Street View (GSV) imagery (n = 3598 from across the USA); and 2) understand whether researcher-assigned theoretical constructs from the literature predict these concepts in intentionally-selected imagery (n = 6). A national sample of participants (n = 10,727) ranked the qualities of 11 randomly assigned images. We found it difficult to accurately predict ratings of beauty, restorativeness, and naturalness using GSV images. Consistently important image variables for the better-performing models included the total edge contrast index, the interspersion-juxtaposition index, and vertical vegetation. Important rater metrics include the binary Hispanic variable and the time the rater took to complete the survey. We also found similar correlations between the concepts of beauty, restorativeness, and naturalness by sex, urbanicity, and race/ethnicity whereby beauty and restorativeness had the largest correlation. We also found distinct constructs in the intentionally-selected images. Beauty and restorativeness could be predicted by the presence of water, and urban, maintained scenes. Imagery with greenery of various heights was associated with lower beauty and restorativeness and higher naturalness. Pure nature scenes were associated with both higher restorativeness and naturalness. For all three concepts, crowded views were significantly associated with lower values. Distinctly, expansive views were associated with beauty, and scenes with traditional structures were associated with lower naturalness. Future research may usefully explore geographic differences in ratings and the past experiences of participants, as drivers of image perceptions. Accurate prediction of image perceptions and understanding why certain people view or do not view particular images as beautiful, restorative, or natural may inform efforts to promote mental health through urban design. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Blue space; Google Street View; Green space; Mental health; Perceptions,greenspace; image analysis; mental health; perception; spatiotemporal analysis; United States,,,,,,Funding for half of the Amazon Mechanical Turk surveys came from Michigan State University's Center for Data Analytics.,"undefined, (2020); Bell, Sarah L., Green space, health and wellbeing: Making space for individual agency, Health and Place, 30, pp. 287-292, (2014); Berman, Marc G., The perception of naturalness correlates with low-level visual Features of environmental scenes, PLOS ONE, 9, 12, (2014); Berman, Marc G., The cognitive benefits of interacting with nature, Psychological Science, 19, 12, pp. 1207-1212, (2008); Berto, Rita, The role of nature in coping with psycho-physiological stress: A literature review on restorativeness, Behavioral Sciences, 4, 4, pp. 394-409, (2014); Aesthetic Measure, (1933); Brown, Daniel K., Viewing nature scenes positively affects recovery of autonomic function following acute-mental stress, Environmental Science and Technology, 47, 11, pp. 5562-5569, (2013); Carrus, Giuseppe, Relations between naturalness and perceived restorativeness of different urban green spaces, Psyecology, 4, 3, pp. 227-244, (2013); Chon, Jinhyung, Aesthetic responses to urban greenway trail environments, Landscape Research, 34, 1, pp. 83-104, (2009); Conradson, David, Landscape, care and the relational self: Therapeutic encounters in rural England, Health and Place, 11, 4, pp. 337-348, (2005)","A.L.

Our sample size included 61 million outpatient encounters across 1169 zipcodes, with 63% women and 30% elderly. A total of 369,344 mental health encounters were identified, with anxiety/stress and depression encounters representing 68.3% and 23.6%, respectively. We found that neighborhoods with a NatureScore of 60+ had lower overall mental health utilization than those below 40 (RR 0.51, 95%CI 0.38–0.69). This relationship persisted for depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety/stress and in neighborhoods with a NatureScore above 80 (p < 0.001). Compared to neighborhoods with a NatureScore below 40, those above 80 had significantly lower depression (aRR 0.68, 95%CI 0.49–0.95) and bipolar (aRR 0.59, 95%CI 0.36–0.99) health encounters after adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors. This novel approach, utilizing NatureScore as a proxy for urban greenness, demonstrates the correlation between a higher NatureScore and reduced mental health utilization. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating nature into our healthcare strategies to promote well-being and mental health. © 2024 by the authors.",depression; mental health; nature; NatureScore; stress; urban design,demography; mental health; neighborhood; socioeconomic conditions; urban area; urban design; adult; age; aged; analysis of variance; anxiety; Article; bipolar disorder; cross-sectional study; depression; employment; ethnicity; female; gender; household income; human; ICD-10-CM; ICD-9; International Classification of Diseases; Kruskal Wallis test; machine learning; major clinical study; middle aged; natural science; outpatient; physiological stress; poverty; race; regression analysis; regression model; sample size; socioeconomics; statistical analysis; Texas; epidemiology; male; mental disease; psychology; United States; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Socioeconomic Factors,,,,,,This research was funded in part by a generous gift from the Marek Family.,"Nguyen, Phi Yen, Effect of nature prescriptions on cardiometabolic and mental health, and physical activity: a systematic review, The Lancet Planetary Health, 7, 4, pp. e313-e328, (2023); Yau, Katherine Ka Yin, Effects of forest bathing on pre-hypertensive and hypertensive adults: A review of the literature, Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine, 25, 1, (2020); Birch, Jo, Nature doesn't judge you – how urban nature supports young people's mental health and wellbeing in a diverse UK city, Health and Place, 62, (2020); de Bell, Siân, Spending time in the garden is positively associated with health and wellbeing: Results from a national survey in England, Landscape and Urban Planning, 200, (2020); Remme, Roy P., An ecosystem service perspective on urban nature, physical activity, and health, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 22, (2021); Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States Results from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, (2020); Mwoka, Meggie, Housing as a Social Determinant of Health: Evidence from Singapore, the UK, and Kenya: the 3-D Commission, Journal of Urban Health, 98, pp. 15-30, (2021); Prokosch, Christopher, Exploring associations between social determinants of health and mental health outcomes in families from socioeconomically and racially and ethnically diverse households, Preventive Medicine, 161, (2022); Feng, Xiaoqi Qi, The nexus between urban green space, housing type, and mental health, Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 57, 9, pp. 1917-1923, (2022); Gonzales-Inca, Carlos A., Residential greenness and risks of depression: Longitudinal associations with different greenness indicators and spatial scales in a Finnish population cohort, Health and Place, 74, (2022)","J.E.

There is an optimum design value for the sky openness and the street enclosure, which need to be balanced with shade while meeting the light of the road. And it is also important to provide appropriate visual permeability. Furthermore, unlike daily activities, it was found that higher function mixture and function density did not have significant positive effects on the road running intensity.

UAVs offer unique advantages over stationary traffic cameras, including greater flexibility in monitoring large and dynamic urban areas. However, detecting small, densely packed vehicles in UAV imagery remains a significant challenge due to occlusion, variations in lighting, and the complexity of urban landscapes. Conventional models often struggle with these issues, leading to inaccurate detections and reduced performance in practical applications. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CFEMNet, an advanced deep learning model specifically designed for high-precision vehicle detection in complex urban environments. CFEMNet is built on the High-Resolution Network (HRNet) architecture and integrates a Context-aware Feature Extraction Module (CFEM), which combines multi-scale feature learning with a novel Self-Attention and Convolution layer setup within a Multi-scale Feature Block (MFB). This combination allows CFEMNet to accurately capture fine-grained details across varying scales, crucial for detecting small or partially occluded vehicles. Furthermore, the model incorporates an Equivalent Feed-Forward Network (EFFN) Block to ensure robust extraction of both spatial and semantic features, enhancing its ability to distinguish vehicles from similar objects. To optimize computational efficiency, CFEMNet employs a local window adaptation of Multi-head Self-Attention (MSA), which reduces memory overhead without sacrificing detection accuracy. Extensive experimental evaluations on the UAVDT and VisDrone-DET2018 datasets confirm CFEMNet’s superior performance in vehicle detection compared to existing models. This new architecture establishes CFEMNet as a benchmark for UAV-enabled traffic management, offering enhanced precision, reduced computational demands, and scalability for deployment in smart city applications. The advancements presented in CFEMNet contribute significantly to the evolution of smart city technologies, providing a foundation for intelligent and responsive traffic management systems that can adapt to the dynamic demands of urban environments. © 2024 The Authors.

The advancement of artificial intelligence has substantially increased convenience for individuals. This research proposes an urban landscape layout model powered by artificial intelligence that automatically generates urban landscape design based on deep learning (URDDL) with two dimensions: emotional tendency and urban landscape appraisal. The input image represents land use and surrounding road conditions, while the output image depicts the selection of the main entrance and the internal spatial function layout. The Pix2Pix model is trained to learn the internal function layout based on varying land use and road conditions. Additionally, a domain-specific dictionary is constructed using an existing semantic resource vocabulary, where positive and negative sentiment words are compared with their corresponding sentiment values, focusing on categories such as Stimulate, Sense, and Action. Experimental results indicate that the absolute average error of the URDDL model is 91.31%, with a maximum error of 96.87%. The degree of fit is highly appropriate for evaluating the emotional prediction of urban landscapes. The findings demonstrate that the URDDL model outperforms traditional design methods regarding generated results, suggesting its potential for future applications in automated landscape design. © (2024), (PeerJ Inc.).

For many, these tools are especially helpful in wading through, distilling, and prioritizing the large economic, social, and environmental datasets that are available for urban sites and for revealing proposals not typically considered in non-generative urban design processes. Some think that generative tools have the power to shift the funda-mental role of the urban designer but at the same time, there are concerns about the potential loss of designer agency. This study is based on the premise that it is necessary to critically evaluate emerging tools like those employed in generative design before they are widely adopted into mainstream practice. Thus, with this work, we studied the role of one generative tool – Spacemaker1 – to better understand the potential challenges and benefits of integrating these techniques into design workflows. We found that, in its current form, this tool cannot replace the detailed work of designers but can, instead, assist them to think outside of the box and with mundane, repetitive tasks. Furthermore, we found promise in a more hybridized future with a co-created design process. © 2024, VDE VERLAG GMBH.

This paper presents a novel approach for analyzing nocturnal urban noise patterns and identifying distinct zones using mobile phone data. Traditional noise-monitoring methods often require specialized equipment and are limited in scope. Our methodology involves gathering audio recordings from city sensors and localization data from mobile phones placed in urban areas over extended periods with a focus on nighttime, when noise profiles shift significantly. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the developed system processes the audio data to extract noise features indicative of different sound sources and intensities. These features are correlated with geographic location data to create comprehensive city noise maps during nighttime hours. Furthermore, this work employs clustering algorithms to identify distinct noise zones within the urban landscape, characterized by their unique noise signatures, reflecting the mix of anthropogenic and environmental noise sources. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using mobile phone data for nocturnal noise analysis and zone identification. The derived noise maps and zones identification provide insights into noise pollution patterns and offer valuable information for policymakers, urban planners, and public health officials to make informed decisions about noise mitigation efforts and urban development. © 2023 by the authors.",clustering algorithms; machine learning; mobile phone sensing; noise patterns; urban environments,,,,,,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/00315/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","This work was supported by the Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e Tecnologia under Grant [UIDB/00315/2020]; and by the project \u201CBLOCKCHAIN.PT (RE-C05-i01.01\u2014Agendas/Alian\u00E7as Mobilizadoras para a Reindustrializa\u00E7\u00E3o, Plano de Recupera\u00E7\u00E3o e Resili\u00EAncia de Portugal\u201D in its component 5\u2014Capitalization and Business Innovation and with the Regulation of the Incentive System \u201CAgendas for Business Innovation\u201D, approved by Ordinance No. 43-A/2022 of 19 January 2022).","Wu, Kang, The Influence of New-Type Urbanization and Environmental Pollution on Public Health: A Spatial Durbin Model Study, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 23, (2023); Conference Noise and Air Pollution Challenges and Opportunities Noise Pollution Human Health A Review, (2017); Sun, Congting, Urbanization and residents’ health: from the perspective of environmental pollution, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 30, 25, pp. 67820-67838, (2023); Asdrubali, Francesco, Innovative Approaches for Noise Management in Smart Cities: a Review, Current Pollution Reports, 4, 2, pp. 143-153, (2018); Pita, Antonio, Cluster analysis of urban acoustic environments on barcelona sensor network data, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 16, (2021); Fredianelli, Luca, Traffic Flow Detection Using Camera Images and Machine Learning Methods in ITS for Noise Map and Action Plan Optimization, Sensors, 22, 5, (2022); Alías-Pujol, Francesc, Review of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks for Environmental Noise Monitoring in Smart Cities, Journal of Sensors, 2019, (2019); Liu, Ye, Internet of things for noise mapping in smart cities: State of the art and future directions, IEEE Network, 34, 4, pp. 112-118, (2020); López Navarro, Juan Manuel, A digital signal processor based acoustic sensor for outdoor noise monitoring in smart cities, Sensors, 20, 3, (2020); Licitra, Gaetano, Acoustic Beamforming Algorithms and Their Applications in Environmental Noise, Current Pollution Reports, 9, 3, pp. 486-509, (2023)","J.A.

This research addresses the critical need for an efficient system to monitor and mitigate air pollution using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The problem statement revolves around the urgency to curb rising pollution levels in cities, necessitating a comprehensive monitoring and control mechanism. The proposed method involves deploying a WSN infrastruc-ture strategically across urban zones to collect real-time air quality data. These networks consist of interconnected sensors capable of measuring various pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Data collection is processed using advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to predict pollution trends and identify high-risk areas. Additionally, the system integrates actuators for prompt mitigation, allowing for immediate response to pollution spikes by activating interventions like air purifiers or traffic rerouting. The flow of the project begins with the deployment and calibration of sensor nodes across the urban landscape. These nodes continuously gather data, feeding it to a central control system for analysis. Advanced algorithms assess the data, providing actionable insights and triggering mitigation strategies when pollution thresholds are exceeded. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in real-time pollution monitoring and timely intervention. The system shows cases with improved air quality in monitored areas, leading to a reduction in health-related issues and environmental degradation. Furthermore, the system’s scalability and adaptability make it a promising solution for urban sustainability initiatives worldwide. © 2024, Scibulcom Ltd.

The objective was to provide insights beneficial for landscape design, urban planning, and the creation of more appealing and sustainable lake parks. To achieve this, two primary methods were employed in this study: the Automated Machine Learning (Auto ML) model and the DeepLab v3+ model. To gather data for the research, 46,444 images were collected from 20 different lake parks from 2019 to 2022. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Flickr, and specific lake park community groups were tapped to source photographs from both professional photographers and the general public. According to the experimental findings, the perceived frequency of natural landscapes was 69.27%, which was higher than that of humanistic landscapes by 30.73%. The perceived intensity was also maintained between 0.09 and 0.25. The perceived frequency of water body landscapes was much greater on a macro-scale, at 73.02%, and the public had various plant preferences throughout the year. Aquatic plant landscapes with low-to-medium green visibility were preferred by the public, according to the landscape share characterization, while amusement rides with medium-to-high openness were preferred. The sky visibility of amusement rides was between 0 and 0.1 and between 0.3 and 0.5, indicating that the public preferred amusement rides with medium-to-high openness. In lake parks, the populace chose settings with less obvious architectural features. When combined, the two models used in this study are useful for identifying and analyzing the intended traits and preferences of lake parks among the general public. They also have theoretical and practical application value for directing the development of lake parks and urban landscapes. © 2024 by the authors.",auto ML modeling; imagery features; lake parks; public perceived preferences,experimental study; image analysis; image classification; machine learning; park management; perception; public sector,,,,,"Pukyong National University, PKNU",This work was supported by the Pukyong National University Research Fund in 2021.,"Barma, Modu, Multiobjective Mathematical Optimization Model for Municipal Solid Waste Management with Economic Analysis of Reuse/Recycling Recovered Waste Materials, Journal of Computational and Cognitive Engineering, 1, 3, pp. 122-137, (2022); Kim, Doeun, Differences in Perceptions of Naturalness among Urban Park User Groups in Seoul, International Review for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development, 10, 4, pp. 112-129, (2022); Shen, Shiguang, Quantitative study on landscape colors of plant communities in urban parks based on natural color system and M-S theory in Nanjing, China, Color Research and Application, 47, 1, pp. 152-163, (2022); Li, Jie, Effects of the spatial patterns of urban parks on public satisfaction: evidence from Shanghai, China, Landscape Ecology, 38, 5, pp. 1265-1277, (2023); Ding, Caichang, Identification effect of least square fitting method in archives management, Heliyon, 9, 9, (2023); J Urban Manag Energy Sustain, (2023); Zheng, Lingyan, Long-memory retention and self-powered ultraviolet artificial synapses realized by multi-cation metal oxide semiconductors, Journal of Materials Chemistry C, 11, 21, pp. 7098-7105, (2023); Jahani, Ali, Landscape aesthetic quality assessment of forest lands: an application of machine learning approach, Soft Computing, 27, 10, pp. 6671-6686, (2023); Nakarmi, Ganga, A crowdsource approach to documenting users' preferences for landscape attributes in the proposed Appalachian Geopark Project in West Virginia, United States, International Journal of Geoheritage and Parks, 11, 2, pp. 310-327, (2023); Egarter Vigl, Lukas, Harnessing artificial intelligence technology and social media data to support Cultural Ecosystem Service assessments, People and Nature, 3, 3, pp. 673-685, (2021)","D.

Recent progress in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) presents promising solutions for addressing this limitation. To accomplish prompt and accurate flood mapping in complex urban areas from high-resolution remote sensing images to support disaster management and response, this study makes contributions in three key aspects: weak training data generation, the improvement of WSSS algorithm, and the construction of benchmark datasets. Firstly, we present a novel yet efficient weak training data generation strategy by decoupling the acquisition of positive and negative samples. This strategy enables the rapid generation of block-level weak annotations assisted by pre-flood river data or the segment anything model (SAM) for zero-shot segmentation, thereby alleviating the burden of weak data labeling. Secondly, to enhance the flood detection results in complex urban landscapes based on low-cost weak labels, we design an end-to-end WSSS framework incorporating tree filtering-based structure constraints and a perturbed dual-branch cross self-distillation mechanism. Lastly, to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we constructed two large aerial imagery datasets, namely Calgary-Flood and Huston-Flood. These datasets encompass diverse urban land covers and include challenging scenarios with extensive shadows, providing a robust benchmark for evaluating our method against various urban environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our weak data annotation strategy substantially enhances efficiency. Additionally, the proposed WSSS framework exhibits superior performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of edge delineation and algorithmic stability. The advancements in weak data annotation strategy, end-to-end model architecture, and benchmark dataset development in this study collectively exploit the potential of the weakly supervised paradigm for rapid flood mapping in urgent situations.

Satellite images captured during daytime have customarily served as the primary resource for this extraction process. However, the emergence of Nighttime Light (NTL) remote sensing data introduces an innovative dimension to this arena. The exploration of NTL data for road extraction remains in its nascent stage, and this study seeks to bridge this gap. We present a refined U-Net model (CA U-Net) integrated with Cross-Attention Mechanisms, meticulously designed to extract roads from Yangwang-1 NTL images. This model incorporates several enhancements, thereby improving its proficiency in identifying and delineating road networks. Through extensive experimentation conducted in the urban landscape of Wenzhou City, the model delivers highly accurate results, achieving an F1 score of 84.46%. These outcomes significantly surpass the performance benchmarks set by Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the Optimal Threshold (OT) method. This promising development paves the way towards maximizing the utility of NTL data for comprehensive mapping and analysis of road networks. Furthermore, the findings underscore the potential of utilizing Yangwang-1 data as a reliable source for road extraction and reaffirm the viability of deploying deep learning frameworks for road extraction tasks utilizing NTL data. ©: © 2024 Zhu et al.

To fill this gap, this study uses deep learning-based methods to extract visitors' movement trajectories (n = 18,592) from a time-lapse video of a promenade in Hong Kong. The trajectories are classified into different groups based on a set of movement indicators. Multinomial logistic regression is used to examine the relationship between trajectory types and the level of interaction with different site features. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is also used to compare the average amount of physical activity among different trajectory types. The results show that interaction with semi-fixed or movable site features is associated with higher odds of people having “playful” trajectories than other types of trajectories. People with “sporty” trajectories and “playful” trajectories on average have the highest amount of physical activity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Physical activity; Play; Public space; Urban design,machine learning; open space; physical activity; regression analysis; urban design; Article; controlled study; Hong Kong; human; movement (physiology); pilot study; playing; public health; public open space; space; sport; videorecording; analysis of variance; environment; exercise; statistical model; China; Analysis of Variance; Environment; Exercise; Humans; Logistic Models; Sports,,,,,"(2020B1212030009); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (GRF17616221)",Funding text 1: This work was supported by Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Grant Number: GRF17616221) and the 2020 Guangdong Science and Technology Department (Grant Number: 2020B1212030009).

We used a total of 117,259 GPS points and 160 person-day data points for elderly individuals living in Uijeongbu-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The differences in the walking environments selected based on the walking purpose were analyzed using a random forest method, and the nonlinear relationship was investigated. In addition, an in-depth analysis was performed by adopting an interpretation approach from global and local perspectives. The findings highlight the significance of walking street pleasure and network properties for leisure walking. Specifically, a green area ratio of 15 % or more positively relationship path choice for leisure, underscoring the importance of sufficient green space. Conversely, the high proportion of green areas typically has negative implications for commercial walking. Road connectivity and integration are predominantly negatively associated with route choice for leisure, indicating a decreased preference for highly integrated roads during leisure walking activities. These findings provide valuable insights for an evidence-based urban design strategy to make walkable environments. It can contribute to urban planning and policy, particularly the development of tailored walkable environments for the older population. © 2023 The Authors",Built environment; Interpretable Machine learning; Non-linear association; Random forest; The elderly; Walking behaviors,Forestry; Leisure; Urban planning; Built environment; Interpretable machine learning; Linear associations; Machine-learning; Non linear; Non-linear association; Random forests; The elderly; Urban design; Walking behavior; Machine learning; aging population; elderly population; greenspace; machine learning; urban planning; urban policy; urban population; walking; Kyonggi; South Korea,,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2022R1F1A1075136); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (Ministry of Science and ICT) (No. 2022R1F1A1075136 ).,"Abbott, Robert D., Walking and dementia in physically capable elderly men, JAMA, 292, 12, pp. 1447-1453, (2004); Adadi, Amina, Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); Alidoust, Sara, Talking while walking: an investigation of perceived neighbourhood walkability and its implications for the social life of older people, Journal of Housing and the Built Environment, 33, 1, pp. 133-150, (2018); Barredo-Arrieta, Alejandro, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, Information Fusion, 58, pp. 82-115, (2020); Ball, Kylie, Perceived environmental aesthetics and convenience and company are associated with walking for exercise among Australian adults, Preventive Medicine, 33, 5, pp. 434-440, (2001); Baobeid, Abdulla Mohamed, Walkability and Its Relationships With Health, Sustainability, and Livability: Elements of Physical Environment and Evaluation Frameworks, Frontiers in Built Environment, 7, (2021); Bassett, David R., Walking, cycling, and obesity rates in Europe, North America and Australia, Journal of Physical Activity and Health, 5, 6, pp. 795-814, (2008); van den Berg, Pauline E.W., Locations that support social activity participation of the aging population, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 12, 9, pp. 10432-10449, (2015); Böcker, Lars, Elderly travel frequencies and transport mode choices in Greater Rotterdam, the Netherlands, Transportation, 44, 4, pp. 831-852, (2017); Borst, Hieronymus C., Relationships between street characteristics and perceived attractiveness for walking reported by elderly people, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 28, 4, pp. 353-361, (2008)","L.

The study investigates two case studies: Perugia, Italy, and Oslo, Norway. Utilizing street-level imagery processed through semantic segmentation, the research quantifies the urban environment using metrics such as the Green View Index (GVI), Sky View Factor (SVF), and Building View Factor (BVF). Perugia, with its historical architecture and compact medieval urban fabric, reveals a concentration of greenery in peripheral zones, with limited green visibility in its dense city center. In contrast, Oslo displays a more uniform integration of green spaces, ensuring high accessibility even within its central urban areas. These disparities reflect differing urban histories, geographic layouts, and planning approaches, emphasizing the challenges of achieving equitable green space distribution in varied contexts. The findings underscore the pivotal role of green spaces in promoting psychological and physical health by mitigating urban stress and enhancing relaxation. The study also highlights the constraints of utilizing proprietary data sources such as Google Street View, advocating for the development of open-access and equitable data frameworks. This research contributes to the field by proposing a scalable and transferable AI-driven methodology for urban landscape evaluation.

However, curing the problem of landscape ecological security is an important part of Homeland security, economic and social sustainable development. We must deal with the relationship between high-quality social development and ecological environment protection on the basis of scientific evaluation. To address this issue, research has provided better data support for feature extraction through image preprocessing. Then the Convolutional neural network in deep learning is trained through a large number of collected measured data. Finally, the pressure state response model is used to evaluate the ecological security of the healing landscape. The results show that the average error of the ground class in 2010 was 13.65%, and the fitting accuracy reached 86.35%, indicating that this method has high accuracy and can be effectively applied in evaluation. Meanwhile, in 2010 and 2019, the average landscape ecological security levels of City A were 7.27 and 6.65, both at a 'safe' level, but the overall security level showed a downward trend. It is recommended to optimize the land use pattern in future urban planning and construction, improve the urban landscape ecological security index value, and maintain consistency with the actual situation of the city. This can provide reference for the evaluation model of urban landscape ecological security, and further provide scientific basis and guidance for the ecological civilization construction of urban agglomerations. In subsequent research, the evolution trend of urban landscape ecological security can be taken as the research goal, and finally, guidance on optimizing urban landscape ecological security can be provided. © 2023 - IOS Press.

A UHI is a city or town area exhibiting a temperature variance from its surrounding environment. Researchers employ various relative UHI parameters to model UHI data and predict temperature fluctuations. For the study area of Srinagar City, Jammu & Kashmir, India, land surface temperature (LST) data and its correlated parameters were sourced from satellite imagery. The LST data for the region were analyzed to understand the development and investigate the UHI effect and its variations. Utilizing an 8-day revisit period during the busiest season month, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite provided LST data from 2001 to 2021. To address the large dataset, which includes 16 samples of LST data per square kilometer each year measured in Kelvin (K), different machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to establish associations for UHI modeling. These clusters were then compared with established scientific categories in the study area. The long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) model, using time-series data, predicted changes in urbanized areas, vegetation cover, wetlands, and other factors. For land use land cover (LULC) prediction, the neural network (NN) model outperformed all others, with Regression (R) = 0.897, Validation = 0.912, and Training = 0.931, and mean squared error (MSE) = 2.012, Validation = 0.191, and Training = 1.124. This paper strives to identify and analyze the relationship between LULC change and LST variations in the context of urbanization. Initially, it examines the correlations between LST and variables such as vegetation, man-made structures, and agriculture, employing built-up indices within each LULC category and vegetation cover. Subsequently, it assesses the impacts of LULC change and urbanization on UHI using hot spot and urban landscape analyses. Finally, it proposes a model employing non-parametric regression to predict future urban climate trends, considering anticipated changes in land cover and land use. © 2023 Mujtaba Shafi et al.",Land surface temperature; Land use land cover; Machine learning; Urban heat islands,,,,,,,,"1st International Student Research Conference 2020 Dhaka Bangladesh, (2020); Dar, Ilyas, Estimation of LST from multi-sensor thermal remote sensing data and evaluating the influence of sensor characteristics., Annals of GIS, 25, 3, pp. 263-281, (2019); Environmental Challenges, (2021); Journal of Computational Environmental Sciences, (2015); Linking People Place and Policy, (2002); Qiao, Zhi, Influences of urban expansion on urban heat island in Beijing during 1989-2010, Advances in Meteorology, 2014, (2014); Shao, Bin, Prediction and visualization for urban heat island simulation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6758, pp. 1-11, (2011); Naim, Md Nazmul Huda, Assessment of urban thermal field variance index and defining the relationship between land cover and surface temperature in Chattogram city: A remote sensing and statistical approach, Environmental Challenges, 4, (2021); Zhou, Ji, Modelling the diurnal variations of urban heat islands with multi-source satellite data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 34, 21, pp. 7568-7588, (2013); Oke, Timothy R., The energetic basis of the urban heat island, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 108, 455, pp. 1-24, (1982)","M.

This paper presents a methodology for the unsupervised classification of Casablanca's land cover using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The study exploits multispectral satellite imagery, in particular Landsat data, to extract meaningful land-use classes without the need for manual labeling. The workflow includes data collection, pre-processing, unsupervised clustering, and visualization of results. By applying the k-means and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) clustering algorithms, the city's land area is divided into distinct clusters, each representing a specific land-use class. The resulting land-use map provides valuable information on Casablanca's urban landscape, highlighting forest areas, crops, built-up infrastructure, water bodies, and barren areas. This automated approach demonstrates the potential of GEE as a powerful tool for land use analysis, enabling effective, data-driven decision-making for urban development and environmental monitoring. The methodology presented can serve as a basis for similar studies in other regions, contributing to the advancement of remote sensing and geospatial analysis techniques for urban and environmental studies. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these two algorithms in terms of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The K-means algorithm recorded moderate accuracy. The LVQ algorithm, on the other hand, performed the least well. © Geoinformatics International.",Google Earth Engine; Land Cover; Machine Learning; Satellite Image; Unsupervised Classification,algorithm; comparative study; land cover; land use; Landsat; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; unsupervised classification; Casablanca [Morocco]; Morocco,,,,,,,"AbuAlghanam, Orieb, Enhancing the Speed of the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) Algorithm by Adding Partial Distance Computation, Cybernetics and Information Technologies, 22, 2, pp. 36-49, (2022); Ali, Ishfaq, Model Selection Using K-Means Clustering Algorithm for the Symmetrical Segmentation of Remote Sensing Datasets, Symmetry, 14, 6, (2022); Artelt, André, Efficient computation of counterfactual explanations of LVQ models, pp. 19-24, (2020); Çelik, Turgay, Unsupervised change detection in satellite images using principal component analysis and κ-means clustering, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 6, 4, pp. 772-776, (2009); Irdp Institut De Recherche Et De Documentation Pedagogique, (2023); Duda, Tanja, Unsupervised classification of satellite imagery: Choosing a good algorithm, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 23, 11, pp. 2193-2212, (2002); Duro, Dennis C., A comparison of pixel-based and object-based image analysis with selected machine learning algorithms for the classification of agricultural landscapes using SPOT-5 HRG imagery, Remote Sensing of Environment, 118, pp. 259-272, (2012); Gascon, Mireia, Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a marker of surrounding greenness in epidemiological studies: The case of Barcelona city, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 19, pp. 88-94, (2016); Gorelick, Noel S., Google Earth Engine: Planetary-scale geospatial analysis for everyone, Remote Sensing of Environment, 202, pp. 18-27, (2017); Heydarian, Mohammadreza, MLCM: Multi-Label Confusion Matrix, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 19083-19095, (2022)","H.

Increasing urbanization throughout the Anthropocene has led to the rise of the urban landscape (‘urbanscape’) as a globally dominant habitat. Though historically less developed, similar urbanization patterns are emerging in the boreal forest, the world's largest forest ecoregion. Here we evaluate the ecological position of migratory Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) in a subarctic urbanscape. We attempt to investigate a summer niche swap theory, in which gulls annually fill a vacant niche otherwise occupied by common ravens in winter. For that investigation we conducted seasonal plot surveys for Short-billed Gull presence from 2013 to 2016 in the Fairbanks, AK municipality. All data were made publicly available. We compiled them in a open source and ESRI geographic information system (GIS) platform and then added 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic U.S. Census data. We trained, tested, and evaluated the performance of an ensemble of machine learning models, resulting in predictions of gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots, at 100-m resolution for inference. We find that Short-billed Gulls prefer the synergy of industrial areas near man-made water bodies, impervious surfaces, gravel pits, strip malls, transfer sites (garbage dumps) and some young forest vegetation. This study is a first-known attempt to utilize a blended ‘Big Data’ approach, in combination with traditional multi-year field-based data collection and alternative model assessments, in order to characterize an urban seabird niche. Our findings, and the digital infrastructure herein, provide an interdisciplinary baseline for potential applications in urban planning and monitoring the spread of disease reservoirs. © 2023 The Authors",Big data; Geographic information system (GIS); Machine learning ensemble predictions (RandomForest Treenet CART MARS); Multi-year field work; Open access data; Short-billed (common/mew) Gull Larus canus; Socio-economics,GIS; machine learning; niche; numerical model; prediction; seabird; subarctic region; summer; theoretical study; urban area; Alaska; Fairbanks; United States,,,,,"(TKP2021-NKTA-32); Nemzeti Kutatási Fejlesztési és Innovációs Hivatal, NKFI","Funding text 1: We would like to express our gratitude to all GIS data providers and open access sources, namely the Fairbanks Municipality.

While landscape metrics have been widely used to reflect land use spatial patterns, the association between the morphological spatial pattern of urban land and pluvial floods is much less understood. Unlike landscape metrics, morphological spatial pattern analysis could discover more spatial information on the formation and layout of land use. To fill such knowledge gap, this research evaluated whether the morphological characteristics of urban land matter to pluvial floods based on machine learning techniques. Pearson's correlation test and random forest algorithm were employed to discover the linear and non-linear associations between the density of flood hotspots and a set of underlying influencing factors, respectively. A case study in a low-lying coastal city has highlighted the strong influence of land use morphological characteristics on pluvial floods with baseline influencing factors considered. The density of flood hotspots was positively associated with the core, loop, edge, and bridge of urban land at sub-watershed level, but negatively associated with islet urban land. While it is unfeasible to restrain rapid urban sprawl and population growth in many developing countries, this research could give specific guidance for upgrading the morphological spatial pattern of urban land. A proper design of key morphological elements may overcome the negative influence of urban expansion on pluvial floods. These findings could help urban planners and policy makers to highlight the importance of land use morphological spatial patterns. © 2023",Morphological spatial pattern; Random forest; Stormwater management; Urban landscape; Urban pluvial flood; Waterlogging,Correlation methods; Developing countries; Forestry; Land use; Machine learning; Population statistics; Urban growth; Landscape metric; Morphological characteristic; Morphological spatial pattern; Pluvials; Random forests; Spatial patterns; Stormwater managements; Urban landscape; Urban pluvial flood; Waterlogging; Floods; coastal zone; developing world; flood; land use; machine learning; population growth; spatial analysis; stormwater; urban design; urban morphology; urban sprawl; waterlogging,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41801307); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (GD23XSH11); Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project, (202201010289); National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, (202311078003); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2023A1515030300)","This study was funded by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Grant No. 2023A1515030300 ), National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (Grant No. 202311078003 ), Guangdong Philosophy and Social Science Foundation (Grant No. GD23XSH11), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41801307 ), and Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project (Grant No. 202201010289 ).","Bi, Shibo, The impact of urban green space morphology on PM2.5 pollution in Wuhan, China: A novel multiscale spatiotemporal analytical framework, Building and Environment, 221, (2022); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Bruwier, M., Influence of urban pattern on inundation flow in floodplains of lowland rivers, Science of the Total Environment, 622-623, pp. 446-458, (2018); Cao, Weiwei, Influential factors affecting protective coping behaviors of flood disaster: A case study in Shenzhen, China, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 16, pp. 1-15, (2020); Chakrabortty, Rabin, Flash-flood hazard susceptibility mapping in Kangsabati River Basin, India, Geocarto International, 37, 23, pp. 6713-6735, (2022); Chang, Heejun, Assessment of urban flood vulnerability using the social-ecological-technological systems framework in six US cities, Sustainable Cities and Society, 68, (2021); Chen, Ming, Effects of urban green space morphological pattern on variation of PM2.5 concentration in the neighborhoods of five Chinese megacities, Building and Environment, 158, pp. 1-15, (2019); Chen, Yangbo, Urban flood risk warning under rapid urbanization, Environmental Research, 139, pp. 3-10, (2015); da Silva, Lucas Borges Leal, A novel spatiotemporal multi-attribute method for assessing flood risks in urban spaces under climate change and demographic scenarios, Sustainable Cities and Society, 76, (2022); Dai, Fei, Spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 concentration at the neighborhood level in five Chinese megacities, Atmospheric Pollution Research, 11, 6, pp. 190-202, (2020)","J.

However, previous studies have mostly predominantly focused on individual perceptions of greenway landscapes, rather than considering the integrated visual characteristics of both the inner and the visible surroundings. This disparity often deviates from people's actual perception of these spaces. To address this gap, we have adopted a new approach to identify the integrated greenway visual characteristics in inner and surrounding landscapes from a human perception perspective, in the city of Wuhan, China. Our methodology involved the utilization of deep learning systems, text semantic analysis, and other techniques to integrate multi-source data, including street view images, remote sensing images, and perceptual comments, to quantitatively assess the landscape sequences and naturalness of landscape changes along the greenway paths. We identify the positions and characteristics of unique landscape nodes within the greenway. The findings of our study revealed ten main landscape types of greenways in Wuhan, with over 72 % of the greenways comprising more than five types. As the length of the greenways increases, the number of landscape types initially experiences rapid growth before reaching a stable state. Furthermore, the frequency of landscape change exhibits a linear and positive correlation with greenway length. Notably, the naturalness of the majority of greenway inner landscapes closely aligns with that of the surrounding visible environment. The openness of all greenways was positively correlated with the proportion of farmland and grassland in their surrounding areas. Furthermore, people exhibit higher positive sentiment responses to greenways that maintain a high level of natural consistency between the inside and outside environments. Additionally, over 47 % of the unique nodes primarily coincide with a specific landscape type and play a vital role in shaping the rhythm of greenway landscape change. These findings provide valuable insights to support the construction and management of greenway landscapes, as well as guidance for urban planners and designers aiming to harness natural resources effectively in the development of urban greenways. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Greenway; Street view image; Surrounding environment; Visual features,Deep learning; Natural resources management; Remote sensing; Semantics; Greenways; Human perception; Integrated visual; Landscape changes; Landscape characteristic; Landscape type; Street view image; Surrounding environment; Visual feature; Learning systems; greenspace; perception; remote sensing; urban design; urban planning; visual analysis; China; Hubei; Wuhan,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (32171858); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2662022YLYJ004); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",This research study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 32171858 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant nos. 2662022YLYJ004 ).,"Anderson, Christopher E., Patterns of cyclist and pedestrian street crossing behavior and safety on an urban greenway, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 16, 2, (2019); Sharma, Archana, Urban greenways: Operationalizing design syntax and integrating mathematics and science in design, Frontiers of Architectural Research, 4, 1, pp. 24-34, (2015); Arendt, Randall G., Linked landscapes: Creating greenway corridors through conservation subdivision design strategies in the northeastern and central United States, Landscape and Urban Planning, 68, 2-3, pp. 241-269, (2004); Badrinarayanan, Vijay, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); Bai, Junwen, A spatial analysis approach for evaluating the service capability of urban greenways - A case study in Wuhan, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 6, 7, (2017); Bai, Yiwei, Exploring Associations between the Built Environment and Cycling Behaviour around Urban Greenways from a Human-Scale Perspective, Land, 12, 3, (2023); Balta, Münevver Özge, Multi criteria decision making methods for urban greenway: The case of Aksaray, Turkey, Land Use Policy, 89, (2019); Bodoque, José María, Flood damage analysis: First floor elevation uncertainty resulting from LiDAR-derived digital surface models, Remote Sensing, 8, 7, (2016); Bryant, Margaret, Urban landscape conservation and the role of ecological greenways at local and metropolitan scales, Landscape and Urban Planning, 76, 1-4, pp. 23-44, (2006); Carlier, Julien, Landscape typology and ecological connectivity assessment to inform Greenway design, Science of the Total Environment, 651, pp. 3241-3252, (2019)","W.

To refer to the management direction of protected areas, various studies have been conducted to identify users' perspectives and find their needs. This study aimed to propose a method to analyze the landscapes perceived by users in Taeanhaean National Park and their spatial distribution by applying crowdsourced photos created and uploaded based on user experiences, Google Vision API, Latent Dirichlet allocation, and the self-organizing map (SOM) machine learning technique. According to the results, Taeanhaean National Park contains 12 major landscape types that include coastal landscapes, forest landscapes, sand dunes, horizontal land landscapes, and urban landscapes. Using crowdsourced photo data, this study was able to identify landscape types that were unrecognized from the perspective of experts or officials and was also able to map the distribution of each landscape type based on the photos' location information. Furthermore, this study aimed to derive the major bases of several landscape types in the large study area through SOM analysis. By using social media data to analyze users’ preferences and perceptions of national parks and large protected areas, this study proposed a potential indicator for a user-participatory landscape monitoring system. Management implications: This study aims to help formulate a management plan considering users’ preferences and perceptions of protected areas using crowdsourced photo data. In the analysis stage, an unsupervised learning method, a type of machine learning, was used to derive landscape areas containing the characteristics of various landscape elements. The study has elucidated the perception of new landscape resources and spaces that the existing analysis could not reveal. Mapping the landscape areas can contribute to the monitoring system of the protected area. ∙ Taeanhaean National Park comprises 12 Landscape types by analyzing users' perceptions using crowdsourced photo data. ∙ Four landscape areas were identified using a self-organizing map. ∙ Social media data and machine learning can be useful for monitoring users' perceptions of national parks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Crowdsourced photo data; Landscape areas; Landscape perception; Protected area; Self-organizing map,,,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2021R1A2C109486012); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF",This work has supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the the Ministry of Science and ICT (No. 2021R1A2C109486012 ).,"Ahn, Haesung, Does urban greenway design affect air pollution exposure?

Nitrogen dioxide (NO<inf>2</inf>) in the urban atmosphere, mainly emitted by anthropogenic sources such as industry and vehicles, is a key precursor of fine particles and ozone pollution. Both NO<inf>2</inf> and its secondary pollutants pose health risks for humans. Here we assess the interactions between urban forms and airborne NO<inf>2</inf> pollution in different cities with various stages of urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China, by using the machine learning and geographical regression model. The results reveal a strong correlation between urban fragmentation and tropospheric NO<inf>2</inf> vertical column density (TVCD) in YRD cities in 2020, particularly those with lower or higher levels of urbanization.

The model is formulated as a Random Forest classifier that predicts the mode-duration probabilities of a given trip. A novel series of predictor features are proposed which measure the urban form, demographics, and service densities on different scales of the transportation network. Through a sensitivity analysis and a proof-of-concept case study, we find that a dense, mixed-use environment with good coverage of a multi-modal mobility network can significantly promote active transportation and public transit use. However, we also find that ultra-dense, centralized developments can lead to increased travel time and increased vehicle use in the urban periphery. Our modeling and analysis method provides a simplified and effective way to assess urban design and planning scenarios from different mobility perspectives and facilitates data-driven, mobility-aware urban design and planning that can help identify better solutions more quickly. © The Author(s) 2023.",machine learning; planning; travel behavior; urban design; urban mobility,machine learning; mobility; public transport; sensitivity analysis; transportation infrastructure; travel behavior; travel time; urban design; urban planning,,,,,"(20.701, 69A3551747119); California Department of Transportation, CT; Council of Fashion Designers of America, CFDA","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by The Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health (CTECH) and Federal Government CFDA #: 20.701 (69A3551747119).; Funding text 2: We thank the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) for providing geocoded NHTS travel survey data.

In this study, we aimed to provide a quantitative design method for urban space design that could take into account the preferences of different populations. Through empirical research, we collected real urban space and population data, which we then quantified using advanced intelligent recognition tools based on deep learning techniques. Our ensuing analysis illuminated the intricate interplay between constituent elements of urban spaces and the structural and emotional changes of residents. By taking into account the specific driving relationships between each element and residents, we proposed a new evaluation methodology for constructing an intelligent design evaluation model for urban spaces. This intelligent design evaluation model was subsequently used to evaluate the urban space both pre- and post-design. The standard deviation of the difference results demonstrated that the design option (SD value = 0.103) and the desired option for Space 1 were lower than the current option (SD value = 0.129) and the expected scheme. Our findings provide quantitative configuration strategies and program evaluation for urban space design, thus helping designers to design urban spaces that are more popular with residents. © 2023 by the authors.",emotion perception; intelligent evaluation; resident effect; space elements; urban space,design method; perception; urban design; urban population,,,,,,,"Chin J Comput, (2005); Life Between Buildings Using Public Space, (1987); Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Futures; Hou, Jingxuan, Quantifying the usage of small public spaces using deep convolutional neural network, PLOS ONE, 15, 10 October, (2020); Frank, Lawrence Douglas, The built environment and human activity patterns: Exploring the impacts of urban form on public health, Journal of Planning Literature, 16, 2, pp. 202-218, (2001); Hong, Jooyoung, Influence of urban contexts on soundscape perceptions: A structural equation modeling approach, Landscape and Urban Planning, 141, pp. 78-87, (2015); Ulrich, Roger S., Visual Landscapes and Psychological Weil-Being, Landscape Research, 4, 1, pp. 17-23, (1979); Ji, Haohao, A new data-enabled intelligence framework for evaluating urban space perception, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 10, 6, (2021); Paköz, Muhammed Ziya, Rethinking urban density, vitality and healthy environment in the post-pandemic city: The case of Istanbul, Cities, 124, (2022); Niu, Tong, Small public space vitality analysis and evaluation based on human trajectory modeling using video data, Building and Environment, 225, (2022)","S.

The image translation technique is used to generate street view images for training data, and procedural modeling can automatically specify the composition of generated street view images and generate annotation data, as well as a variety of 3D models.

This urban growth has a detrimental impact on the health and comfort of residents. The comfort level experienced in any given region depends on various parameters, including atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, land use and land cover (LULC). In this study, we aim to examine the spatial variation of outdoor thermal comfort in the city of Hyderabad. To achieve this, we utilize medium-resolution Landsat 8 imageries along with in situ meteorological data. The classification of LULC is carried out using the maximum likelihood method. A machine learning tool known as Support Vector Machine (SVM) is implemented, with seven environmental indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), new built-up index (NBI), LST, brightness, greenness, and wetness to predict outdoor thermal comfort (THI). The study reveals significant variations in THI across different land covers. Barren lands exhibit the highest mean THI values (27.3), followed by built-up areas (26.9), vegetation (24.1), and water bodies (20.7). These findings indicate that barren and built-up areas are associated with higher levels of discomfort, while vegetated regions and water bodies provide more neutral to moderate comfort conditions. These results also highlight distinct spatial variations in THI across different regions of the city, demonstrating the influence of the urban landscape on outdoor thermal comfort. This research is vital for identifying specific areas within cities that require targeted mitigation strategies to enhance outdoor comfort. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Landsat 8; outdoor thermal comfort; SVM; urban landscape,Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Land use; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Meteorology; Support vector machines; Urban growth; Vegetation; Built-up areas; Land use and land cover; LANDSAT; Landsat 8; Learning tool; Machine-learning; Outdoor thermal comfort; Spatial variations; Support vectors machine; Urban landscape; Landsat; air temperature; machine learning; metropolitan area; spatial variation; support vector machine; urban growth; Hyderabad [Telangana]; India; Telangana,,,,,"U.S. Geological Survey, USGS; Ministry of Education, India, MoE; Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, IIT KGP","Funding text 1: The first author of the manuscript, Hari Prasad, gratefully acknowledges the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur for conduct of the research work as a part of PhD work and providing the MHRD, Government of India, fellowship.

Through research in the fields of urban planning, urban design, and cognitive psychology, this paper defines three ecological evaluation indexes correspondingly. They measure the vegetation coverage of land (planning green), the visibility of vegetation from the pedestrian’s viewpoint (visual green), and the psychological perception of greenery by human (perceived green). This study uses computerized parametric analysis, computerized deep learning, data visualization, and statistical methods to achieve an accurate description of the three evaluation indicators. This study assumes that the three green values may behave consistently or inconsistently at each point. Therefore, this study, on the one hand, tries to analyze the potential factors affecting each green indicator. On the other hand, by analysing the consistency or discrepancy of the three green values, this research revealed the potential link between urban spatial type and integrated ecological properties. Four areas of Brisbane dominated by different functions were selected for this study (Red Hill and Bardon for residential areas, Brisbane City for downtown CBD, and Woolloongabba for industrial areas). The results of the study demonstrate the credibility and applicability of the three green indicators in different areas, examine the various factors affecting ecology, and provide new design strategies and ideas for urban designers. © The Author(s) 2023.",green perception; street view image; subjective measurement; urban ecology; Urban green space,Data visualization; Deep learning; Urban planning; Vegetation; Cognitive psychology; Comprehensive evaluation system; Ecological evaluation; Green indicator; Green perception; Street view image; Subjective measurements; Urban design; Urban ecology; Urban green spaces; Ecology,,,,,,,"Ecological Urbanism, (2010); Urban Ecology, (1998); Urban Ecology, (2010); Kabisch, Nadja, Human-environment interactions in urban green spaces - A systematic review of contemporary issues and prospects for future research, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 50, pp. 25-34, (2015); Ma, Xiangyuan, Measuring human perceptions of streetscapes to better inform urban renewal: A perspective of scene semantic parsing, Cities, 110, (2021); Ewing, Reid H., Measuring the unmeasurable: Urban design qualities related to walkability, Journal of Urban Design, 14, 1, pp. 65-84, (2009); Xiao, Chao, Assessing the spatial distribution pattern of street greenery and its relationship with socioeconomic status and the built environment in Shanghai, China, Land, 10, 8, (2021); Li, Xiaojiang, Does the visibility of greenery increase perceived safety in urban areas?

With the ubiquitous use of social media and the prosperous developments in machine and deep learning, it has become feasible to collect and process massive amounts of information produced by online communities about their perceptions of heritage as social constructs. Moreover, such information is usually inter-connected and embedded within specific socioeconomic and spatiotemporal contexts. This paper presents a methodological workflow for using semi-supervised learning with graph neural networks (GNN) to classify, summarize, and map cultural significance categories based on user-generated content on social media. Several GNN models were trained as an ensemble to incorporate the multi-modal (visual and textual) features and the contextual (temporal, spatial, and social) connections of social media data in an attributed multi-graph structure. The classification results with different models were aligned and evaluated with the prediction confidence and agreement. Furthermore, message diffusion methods on graphs were proposed to aggregate the post labels onto their adjacent spatial nodes, which helps to map the cultural significance categories in their geographical contexts. The workflow is tested on data gathered from Venice as a case study, demonstrating the generation of social perception maps for this UNESCO World Heritage property. This research framework could also be applied in other cities worldwide, contributing to more socially inclusive heritage management processes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology holds the potential of diffusing any human-generated location-based information onto spatial networks and temporal timelines, which could be beneficial for measuring the safety, vitality, and/or popularity of urban spaces. © 2023 The Author(s)",Graph Neural Networks; Heritage values and attributes; Label diffusion; Multi-modal machine learning; Social media data; Spectral centrality,Graph neural networks; Learning systems; Photomapping; Social networking (online); Urban planning; Heritage value and attribute; Heritage values; Label diffusion; Machine-learning; Multi-modal; Multi-modal machine learning; Social media datum; Social perception; Spectral centrality; Deep learning; artificial neural network; cultural heritage; culture; detection method; machine learning; mapping method; perception; social media; spectral analysis; supervised classification; UNESCO; Italy; Veneto; Venezia [Veneto]; Venice,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (813883); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA; Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: The presented study is within the framework of the Heriland-Consortium.

Recent years have witnessed notable advancements in land use/cover classification, driven by improvements in classification methods and the utilization of data from multiple sources. Deep learning networks, especially, have gained prominence in various image analysis tasks, including land use/cover classification. However, when it comes to urban areas, the classification of urban land use/cover encounters additional obstacles, including the complexity of classes, limited training data, and the presence of numerous urban categories. To overcome the limitations arising from similar classes and insufficient training data, we propose a novel approach that integrates hyperspectral and LiDAR data through a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for semantic segmentation. Our methodology leverages the UNet + + generator and PatchGAN discriminator to achieve accurate segmentation. The CGAN-generated segmented images are then processed by a fully connected neural network (FCN) to classify 20 land use/cover classes. By validating our approach on the 2018 GRSS Data Fusion dataset, our study demonstrates its exceptional operational performance. The CGAN architecture outperforms previous algorithms in terms of class diversity and training data volume. By generating synthetic data that closely resembles the ground truth, the CGAN enhances the classification performance. Clear visual distinctions are observed among various urban features, such as vegetation, trees, buildings, roads, and cars. Classes associated with healthy grass, stressed grass, bare earth, and stadium seats achieve high accuracy. However, road and railway classes exhibit poorer performance due to their similarity with sidewalk, highway, major thoroughfare, and crosswalk classes. Overall, our study showcases a significant improvement in classification accuracy, achieving an approximate accuracy of 96.98% compared to the winning articles presented in the 2018 competition, which achieved accuracies of 64.95% and 76.54%, respectively. This improvement in accuracy can be attributed to the effective extraction and combination of high and low-level urban land cover/land use features within our proposed architecture. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",CGAN; Fusion; Land use classification; Multi-source data; Patchgan; UNet + +,artificial neural network; image analysis; land classification; land use planning; lidar; semantic standardization; urban area,,,,,,"The authors are grateful to the committee of the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest for providing the hyperspectral and LiDAR data, and their efforts in promoting the development of multisource remote-sensing data fusion.","Akar, Ozlem, Land use/land cover mapping from airborne hyperspectral images with machine learning algorithms and contextual information, Geocarto International, 37, 14, pp. 3963-3990, (2022); Bousias Alexakis, Evangelos, Evaluation of unet and unet++ architectures in high resolution image change detection applications, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 43, B3, pp. 1507-1514, (2020); Chen, Xiaoling, Remote sensing image-based analysis of the relationship between urban heat island and land use/cover changes, Remote Sensing of Environment, 104, 2, pp. 133-146, (2006); Chen, Yushi, Deep fusion of hyperspectral and LiDAR data for thematic classification, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2016-November, pp. 3591-3594, (2016); Chen, Gang, Multi-scale patch-GAN with edge detection for image inpainting, Applied Intelligence, 53, 4, pp. 3917-3932, (2023); Debes, Christian, Hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion: Outcome of the 2013 GRSS data fusion contest, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 7, 6, pp. 2405-2418, (2014); Feng, Quanlong, Multisource hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion for urban land-use mapping based on a modified two-branch convolutional neural network, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 8, 1, (2019); 22nd Earsel Symposium Geoinformation for European Wide Integration, (2025); Herold, M., Spectrometry for urban area remote sensing - Development and analysis of a spectral library from 350 to 2400 nm, Remote Sensing of Environment, 91, 3-4, pp. 304-319, (2004); Huang, Xin, Information fusion of aerial images and LIDAR data in urban areas: Vector-stacking, re-classification and post-processing approaches, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 32, 1, pp. 69-84, (2011)","M.

This study adopted ambulatory sensing to monitor high spatiotemporal physiological stress from skin conductance level (SCL) and analyzed the association between the visual environment and the SCL in high-density environments. The multi-level visual environment was quantified from isovist and street view images. The most influential lags for each visual exposure factor were identified. Furthermore, multiple linear regression (MLR) and geographical random forest (GRF) were established to examine the effects of the lagged visual exposure factors on SCL. Particularly, the GRF can explore spatial nonstationary and complex relationships. The MLR (R2 = 0.466) suggests that exposure to trees, sky, and sign symbols can relieve stress. The GRF with 5 visual exposure factors can explain 87.4% of the spatial variance of SCL. This study confirms the effectiveness of monitoring pedestrians’ stress in high-density cities and the phased and non-instantaneous impacts of the visual environment. The results have practical implications in urban design at both district and site levels for a sustainable and psychologically friendly urban environment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Ambulatory technology; Geographical random forest; Isovist; Moving window; Skin conductance level; Street view,Forestry; Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Physiology; Sustainable development; Ambulatory technology; Geographical random forest; Isovists; Moving window; Physiological stress; Random forests; Skin conductance; Skin conductance level; Street view; Visual environments; Urban growth; geographical thought; pedestrian; physiological response; planning process; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban design; vision,,,,,"Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2042023kf0004)",The study is supported by a PGS studentship from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

This has significant implications for ventilation, overheating, wind chill, and safety concerns such as down drafts from skyscrapers. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are the best practice for analyzing urban airflow patterns in design, they are computationally expensive and require a high level of expertise, making them underutilized in the early design process. This paper presents a surrogate model for CFD using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can process arbitrary building geometries. The model is trained using an automated end-to-end pipeline based on Eddy3D and implemented within the Rhino and Grasshopper environment as an Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)-based CFD-GAN predictor. This workflow provides instantaneous simulation feedback within the design software, reduces the risk of user error, and allows for appropriate spatial resolution in early design. The CFD-GAN demonstrates promising accuracy, with a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) ranging from 75%–97% on a limited training dataset of 564 unique urban geometries. Although the model currently has limitations regarding accuracy in complex urban wake regions, we show that these are likely not of concern for outdoor thermal comfort analyses. While it cannot replace CFD in later design stages, the CFD-GAN facilitates the incorporation of urban airflow analysis in early design with minimal effort and instantaneous performance feedback. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Generative Adversarial Network (GAN); Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX); Pedestrian comfort; Surrogate modeling; Urban design,Air; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer software; Design; Office buildings; Tall buildings; Airflow patterns; Computational fluid dynamic; Early designs; Generative adversarial network; Network-based; Neural-networks; Open neural network exchange; Pedestrian comfort; Surrogate modeling; Urban design; Generative adversarial networks; airflow; building; computational fluid dynamics; machine learning; modeling; pedestrian; prediction; urban design,,,,,,We would like to thank Panagiotis Michalatos for his helpful remarks regarding Pix2Pix and his help with OpenCV image manipulation.,"Blocken, Bert J.E., Computational Fluid Dynamics for urban physics: Importance, scales, possibilities, limitations and ten tips and tricks towards accurate and reliable simulations, Building and Environment, 91, pp. 219-245, (2015); Piracha, Awais, Urban Air Pollution, Urban Heat Island and Human Health: A Review of the Literature, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 15, (2022); Vanky, Anthony P., Effect of weather on pedestrian trip count and duration: City-scale evaluations using mobile phone application data, Preventive Medicine Reports, 8, pp. 30-37, (2017); Reinhart, Christoph F., Biometeorological indices explain outside dwelling patterns based on Wi-Fi data in support of sustainable urban planning, Building and Environment, 126, pp. 422-430, (2017); Nazarian, Negin, Outdoor thermal comfort autonomy: Performance metrics for climate-conscious urban design, Building and Environment, 155, pp. 145-160, (2019); Mattoni, Benedetta, Comparison among different green buildings assessment tools: Application to a case study, Building Simulation Applications, 2017-February, pp. 97-104, (2017); Kastner, Patrick, A cylindrical meshing methodology for annual urban computational fluid dynamics simulations, Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 13, 1, pp. 59-68, (2020); Kastner, Patrick, Eddy3D: A toolkit for decoupled outdoor thermal comfort simulations in urban areas, Building and Environment, 212, (2022); Bre, Facundo, Prediction of wind pressure coefficients on building surfaces using artificial neural networks, Energy and Buildings, 158, pp. 1429-1441, (2018); Jin, Xiaowei, Prediction model of velocity field around circular cylinder over various Reynolds numbers by fusion convolutional neural networks based on pressure on the cylinder, Physics of Fluids, 30, 4, (2018)","P.

Tree planting, a crucial aspect of green infrastructure, has been analyzed for optimized positioning using data metrics, priority scoring, and GIS. However, due to the dynamic nature of environmental information, the accuracy of current approaches is compromised. This study aims to present a novel approach integrating deep learning and cellular automata to prioritize urban tree planting locations to anticipate the optimal urban tree network. Initially, GIS data were collated and visualized to identify a suitable study site within London. CycleGAN models were trained using cellular automata outputs and forest mycorrhizal network samples. The comparison validated cellular automata’s applicability, enabled observing spatial feature information in the outputs and guiding the parameter design of our 3D cellular automata system for predicting tree planting locations. The locations were optimized by simulating the network connectivity of urban trees after planting, following the spatial-behavioral pattern of the forest mycorrhizal network. The results highlight the role of robust tree networks in fostering ecological stability and cushioning climate change impacts in urban contexts. The proposed approach addresses existing methodological and practical limitations, providing innovative strategies for optimal tree planting and prioritization of urban green infrastructure, thereby informing sustainable urban planning and design. Our findings illustrate the symbiotic relationship between urban trees and future cities and offer insights into street tree density planning, optimizing the spatial distribution of trees within urban landscapes for sustainable urban development. © 2023 by the authors.",carbon emissions; ecological system; green infrastructure; urban forestry; urban planting,accuracy assessment; cellular automaton; climate change; urban area; urban development; urban forestry; urban planning; England; London [England]; United Kingdom,,,,,,,"Di Vita, Giuseppe Antonio, A review of the role of vegetal ecosystems in CO2 capture, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 10, (2017); Wang, Nuo, Accounting for China’s Net Carbon Emissions and Research on the Realization Path of Carbon Neutralization Based on Ecosystem Carbon Sinks, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 22, (2022); Sima, Sergiu, Phase Behavior of Carbon Dioxide + Isobutanol and Carbon Dioxide + tert-Butanol Binary Systems, Energies, 15, 7, (2022); Reichle, David E., The Global Carbon Cycle and Climate Change: Scaling Ecological Energetics from Organism to the Biosphere, pp. 1-677, (2023); Walther, Gian Reto, Ecological responses to recent climate change, Nature, 416, 6879, pp. 389-395, (2002); Climate Change 2001 Synthesis Report, (2001); Science, (2021); Badiou, Pascal H.

Station-level boarding and alighting ridership at different times of the day was obtained from smart card records and used as the dependent variable. Nineteen independent variables, including land use, were calculated based on the directional and size-various catchment area defined by shared bike's origin-destination data. This framework, which accounts for spatial heterogeneity demonstrated strong goodness-of-fit and prediction capability, which has been ignored in previous studies. Furthermore, the proposed framework contributed to modeling based on geographical weighted regression and global machine learning models. Local relative importance mapping of built environment variables revealed varying impacts across Shanghai, diverging from the common practice of averaging into a single value in global machine learning models. Additionally, the nonlinear relationship between influencing variables, such as leisure and shopping, demonstrated a positive trend with boarding and alighting ridership in different periods, and spatio-temporal heterogeneity with the effective range and threshold effect. Rather than focusing on increasing development density to boost metro ridership, this study assesses the saturation of station-level built environment to enable more accurate decision-making based on location, station design, station-area planning, and investment priorities in urban areas. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",built environment; metro ridership; nonlinear effects; spatial heterogeneity; spatial validation,Catchments; Decision trees; Investments; Land use; Leisure; Machine learning; Urban planning; Built environment; Calibration and validations; Gradient boosting; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Metro ridership; Nonlinear effect; Spatial calibration; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial validation; Smart cards; decision making; investment; machine learning; metro system; nonlinearity; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; travel behavior; urban design; urban transport; China; Shanghai,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (20ZR1462200); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52078343); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (22120210540); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52078343 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai ( 20ZR1462200 ) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 22120210540 ).

Taking the city of Guangzhou as a case study, deep learning was combined with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform effective image recognition, vector cutting, and automatic area statistics based on multilevel road networks. Road network division, block area processing, characteristic parameter calculation, and LCZ classification were integrated to automatically generate block-scale-oriented LCZ maps, which was achieved via threshold contrast using the recommended parameter intervals of the calculated characteristic parameters. Basic land surface temperature (LST) data for summer to winter in Guangzhou were then applied, and correlation analysis was conducted between the block-scale LST vector and LCZ characteristic parameters. The results demonstrate the applicability and potential of the CNN algorithm for urban climate analysis. The developed CNN-based LCZ mapping approach prioritizes “block” scale analysis and typical characteristic parameters in each block are obtained with high calculation accuracy.

Geographically weighted regression (GWR), machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely XGBoost and LightGBM, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods are utilized. The study observes that urban areas are often cooler due to the presence of urban heat sinks (UHSs), more noticeably in coastal cities. However, LST is seen to increase across all cities due to urbanization and the degradation of vegetation cover. The increase in LST is more pronounced in inland cities surrounded by barren landscapes. Interestingly, XGBoost frequently outperforms LightGBM in the analyses. ML models and SHAP demonstrate efficacy in deciphering urban heat dynamics despite data quality and model tuning challenges. The study’s results highlight the crucial role of ongoing urbanization, topography, and the existence of water bodies and vegetation in driving LST dynamics. These findings underscore the importance of sustainable urban planning and vegetation cover in mitigating urban heat, thus having significant policy implications. Despite its contributions, this study acknowledges certain limitations, primarily the use of data from only four discrete years, thereby overlooking inter-annual, seasonal, and diurnal variations in LST dynamics. © 2023 by the authors.",Land Surface Temperature (LST); machine learning; Moroccan urban landscapes,Atmospheric temperature; Dynamics; Land surface temperature; Public policy; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Topography; Urban planning; Vegetation; Comparative analyzes; Machine-learning; Moroccan urban landscape; Shapley; Temperature dynamics; Thermal variation; Urban landscape; Vegetation cover; Machine learning; city; environmental monitoring; high temperature; procedures; temperature; urbanization; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; Temperature; Urbanization,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (22F22303, 22KF0054)",This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 22F22303 and 22KF0054.,"Li, Zhaoliang, Satellite-derived land surface temperature: Current status and perspectives, Remote Sensing of Environment, 131, pp. 14-37, (2013); Voogt, James A., Thermal remote sensing of urban climates, Remote Sensing of Environment, 86, 3, pp. 370-384, (2003); Derdouri, Ahmed, Understanding the links between lulc changes and suhi in cities: Insights from two-decadal studies (2001–2020), Remote Sensing, 13, 18, (2021); Athukorala, Darshana, Urban heat island formation in greater cairo: Spatio-temporal analysis of daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures along the urban-rural gradient, Remote Sensing, 13, 7, (2021); Wang, Ruci, Spatiotemporal analysis of land use/cover patterns and their relationship with land surface temperature in Nanjing, China, Remote Sensing, 12, 3, (2020); Deilami, Kaveh, Urban heat island effect: A systematic review of spatio-temporal factors, data, methods, and mitigation measures, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 67, pp. 30-42, (2018); World Cities Report 2020 the Value of Sustainable Urbanization, (2020); Journal of Geographic Information System, (2012); Lachir, Asia, Modeling the Urban Impact on Semiarid Surface Climate: A Case Study in Marrakech, Morocco, Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing, 42, 4, pp. 379-395, (2016); Bahi, Hicham, Effects of urbanization and seasonal cycle on the surface urban heat island patterns in the coastal growing cities: A case study of Casablanca, Morocco, Remote Sensing, 8, 10, (2016)","A.

However, planning for active mobility is a complex endeavour due to numerous local, place-based factors that influence active mobility decisions. Recent advancements in urban data research have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning methods in evaluating active mobility potential for urban environments. At present, the incorporation of semantic information from deep learning models and street view imagery into spatio-temporal contexts remains a challenge. In particular, knowledge extraction from deep learning models remains an open question for urban planning and decision-making. Towards this issue, we propose a functional deep learning and network science workflow that employs open data from OpenStreetMap and Mapillary to assess factors affecting active mobility decisions and route planning. We demonstrate the generalisability of our analytical workflow through two case studies focusing on urban greenery in Nerima city (Japan) and urban visual complexity in Pasir Ris town (Singapore). Our results reveal clear patterns of heterogeneity in urban streetscapes and identify unevenness in street infrastructure provision based on destination types. Using this information, we propose specific areas for design intervention to improve active mobility planning. Our workflow is applicable for a diverse range of use cases making it relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, not limited to, urban researchers, policy makers and urban planners. © The Author(s) 2022.",Computer vision; machine learning; urban analytics; volunteered geographic information; walking behaviour,computer vision; decision making; GIS; machine learning; mobility; network analysis; urban design; urban planning; walking; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Nerima; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Tokyo [Kanto]; Tokyo [Tokyo (PRF)],,,,,"National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-295-000-171-133); National University of Singapore, NUS","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore Grant (R-295-000-171-133).","Agryzkov, Taras, A variant of the current flow betweenness centrality and its application in urban networks, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 347, pp. 600-615, (2019); Alvarez Leon, Luis Felipe, The value of crowdsourced street-level imagery: examining the shifting property regimes of OpenStreetCam and Mapillary, GeoJournal, 84, 2, pp. 395-414, (2019); Anselin, Luc E., Open Source Software for Spatial Data Science, Geographical Analysis, 54, 3, pp. 429-438, (2022); Trees in Urban Design, (1980); Arribas-Bel, Daniel, Open data products-A framework for creating valuable analysis ready data, Journal of Geographical Systems, 23, 4, pp. 497-514, (2021); Banerjee, Tridib, Walking to School: The Experience of Children in Inner City Los Angeles and Implications for Policy, Journal of Planning Education and Research, 34, 2, pp. 123-140, (2014); Basu, Rounaq, How do street attributes affect willingness-to-walk?

Our objective is to quantify and map landscape value by developing a novel intelligent landscape value evaluation method based on online texts. We argue that online texts can be converted into quantities through deep learning technology, which allows the measurement of public preference, emotional tendency and intensity. We selected perception frequency, perception heat, perception preference and the value index as indicators to quantify landscape value, which is the product of perception heat and perception preference. We collected more than 14,000 online texts about the Orange Islands in Changsha city from 2010 to 2020, analysed the perception heat using Python to extract data, and analysed the perception preference using Baidu API sentiment analysis technology. The results show that the novel method has a wide range of data sources and represents the real public perception and value orientation, demonstrating that online texts with a wealth of mined information can be used to evaluate landscape value. The model calculating the landscape value overcomes the shortcomings of current methods that ignore public preference, emotional tendency and intensity. The results also show that the conservation mode of Orange Island is successful, and the conservation method suggested by the recommendation on the historic urban landscape is feasible. The study highlights the contribution of public preferences to landscape value and provides insight into the situations and variations of value types on Orange Island. The novel method is highly intelligent, time-saving, has low labour costs, and is applicable and can be applied to the evaluation of landscape value, especially in cases where value conflicts exist. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Cultural ecosystem services; Historic urban landscape; Machine learning; Orange island; Public perception; Social media,cultural heritage; ecosystem service; heritage conservation; Internet; landscape structure; machine learning; mapping method; perception; quantitative analysis; social behavior; social media; urban area; urban history; Changsha; China; Hunan,,,,,,,"Alessa, Lilian Na Ia, Social-ecological hotspots mapping: A spatial approach for identifying coupled social-ecological space, Landscape and Urban Planning, 85, 1, pp. 27-39, (2008); Alphan, Hakan, Geospatial analysis of lake scenery as an indicator for the environment: The City of Van (Turkey) and its surroundings, Environmental and Sustainability Indicators, 9, (2021); Values and Heritage Conservation, (2000); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2015); Bandarin, Francesco, The Historic Urban Landscape: Managing Heritage in an Urban Century, (2012); undefined, (2019); Barthel-Bouchier, Diane, Cultural heritage and the challenge of sustainability, pp. 1-235, (2016); Biedenweg, Kelly A., Is recreation a landscape value?: Exploring underlying values in landscape values mapping, Landscape and Urban Planning, 185, pp. 24-27, (2019); Brown, Greg Gordon, Mapping spatial attributes in survey research for natural resource management: Methods and applications, Society and Natural Resources, 18, 1, pp. 17-39, (2005); International Journal of Tourism Research, (2006)","Q.

However, two aspects of VCA still need improvement for more detailed modeling of urban landscape dynamics. One is the lack of simulation of urban renewal prevalent in megacities. The other is the lack of simulation of vertical urban landscape dynamics at the parcel level. Hence, this study should be the first to propose a comprehensive VCA framework for modeling horizontal and vertical multi-type urban landscape dynamics (HV-MVCA) at the parcel level. The HV-MVCA consists of two modules: a deep learning-based horizontal urban landscape dynamic simulation module and a random forest-based (RF) vertical metrics prediction module. Compared with traditional VCA, the HV-MVCA can obtain the highest simulation accuracy with an enhancement of 1.45%-4.56%. The RF-based fitting model can reasonably interpret the vertical metric as the coefficient of determination and the mean absolute percentage error was 0.88 and 28.93%. By localizing shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), the horizontal and vertical urban landscape dynamics in the future can be simulated under different scenarios. As the multi-scenario simulation results can provide abundant horizontal and vertical information at the parcel level, the proposed HV-MVCA can help achieve a more comprehensive assessment of many urban-related issues with these indicators, such as energy consumption, climate change, and pollution emissions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Deep learning; Horizontal and vertical dimensions; Multi-type urban landscape dynamics; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Vector-based cellular automata,cellular automaton; landscape; simulation; socioeconomic impact; urban renewal,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42130107); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",This study was supported by the Key National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42130107).,"undefined, (2008); Jokar Arsanjani, Jamal, Integration of logistic regression, Markov chain and cellular automata models to simulate urban expansion, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 21, 1, pp. 265-275, (2013); undefined, (2013); Barr, Jason M., Skyscraper Height, Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 45, 3, pp. 723-753, (2012); Barreira-González, Pablo, From raster to vector cellular automata models: A new approach to simulate urban growth with the help of graph theory, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 54, pp. 119-131, (2015); Cao, Min, A new discovery of transition rules for cellular automata by using cuckoo search algorithm, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 29, 5, pp. 806-824, (2015); Chen, Guangzhao, Global projections of future urban land expansion under shared socioeconomic pathways, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Chen, Yimin, An extended patch-based cellular automaton to simulate horizontal and vertical urban growth under the shared socioeconomic pathways, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 91, (2022); Chen, Yimin, Urban form simulation in 3D based on cellular automata and building objects generation, Building and Environment, 226, (2022); Chen, Yidan, Provincial and gridded population projection for China under shared socioeconomic pathways from 2010 to 2100, Scientific Data, 7, 1, (2020)","X.

However, since a dataset consisting of a huge amount of image and label pairs is required to utilize this technology, in most cases, a model trained with a dataset having similar characteristics is used for analysis, and as a result, the quality of segmentation is poor. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid model to leverage the strengths of each model in predicting specific classes. In particular, we first introduce a pre-processing operation to reduce the differences between the collected urban dataset and public dataset. Subsequently, we train several segmentation models with a pre-processed dataset then, based on the weight rule, the segmentation results are fused to create one segmentation map. To evaluate our proposal, we collected Google Street View images that do not have any labels and trained a model using the cityscapes dataset which contains foregrounds similar to the collected images. We quantitatively assessed its performance using the cityscapes dataset with ground truths and qualitatively evaluated the results of GSV data segmentation through user studies. Our approach outperformed existing methods and demonstrated the potential for accurate and efficient urban environment analysis using computer vision technology. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; hybrid model; image segmentation; streetscapes; urban environment analysis,,,,,,"Semyung University, (2022); Semyung University; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (103434); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI",This paper was supported by the Semyung University Research Grant of 2022.,"Rousselet, Jérôme, Assessing Species Distribution Using Google Street View: A Pilot Study with the Pine Processionary Moth, PLOS ONE, 8, 10, (2013); Rzotkiewicz, Amanda T., Systematic review of the use of Google Street View in health research: Major themes, strengths, weaknesses and possibilities for future research, Health and Place, 52, pp. 240-246, (2018); Yin, Li, Big data' for pedestrian volume: Exploring the use of Google Street View images for pedestrian counts, Applied Geography, 63, pp. 337-345, (2015); Berland, Adam, Google Street View shows promise for virtual street tree surveys, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 21, pp. 11-15, (2017); Liu, Dongwei, Establishing a citywide street tree inventory with street view images and computer vision techniques, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 100, (2023); Gupta, Kshama, Urban Neighborhood Green Index - A measure of green spaces in urban areas, Landscape and Urban Planning, 105, 3, pp. 325-335, (2012); Kim, Jae Hong, Decoding urban landscapes: Google street view and measurement sensitivity, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 88, (2021); Rundle, Andrew G., Using google street view to audit neighborhood environments, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 40, 1, pp. 94-100, (2011); Lu, Yi, The effect of street-level greenery on walking behavior: Evidence from Hong Kong, Social Science and Medicine, 208, pp. 41-49, (2018); Ye, Yu, Measuring daily accessed street greenery: A human-scale approach for informing better urban planning practices, Landscape and Urban Planning, 191, (2019)","S.

The calm wind area caused by inappropriate building arrangements results in pollutant accumulation. To realize a practical design and improve urban microclimate, we investigated the spatial relationship between roads, buildings, and open space using the machine learning technique. First, region growing and k-means clustering were employed to identify roads and buildings. Based on the image masking program, we selected training areas according to the land use map. Second, we used the multiple-point statistics technique to create new urban fabric images. Viewing the training image as a prior model, our program constantly reproduced morphological structures in the target area. We intensified the similarity with training areas and enriched the variability among generated images. Third, Hausdorff distance and multidimensional scaling were applied to achieve a quality examination. The proposed method was performed to fulfill an urban renovation design in Xi’an, China. Based on the historical record, we applied computational fluid dynamics to simulate air circulation and ventilation. The results indicate that the size of calm wind area is reduced. The wind environment is significantly improved due to the rising wind speed. © 2023 by the authors.",machine learning; multiple-point statistics; urban fabric; urban renovation design; wind environment,computational fluid dynamics; historical record; image analysis; machine learning; spatial analysis; urban design; wind velocity; China; Shaanxi; Xian,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2022JQ-227); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (300102341308); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This research was funded by Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, grant number 2022JQ-227, and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China, grant number 300102341308.","Shen, Jialei, An investigation on the effect of street morphology to ambient air quality using six real-world cases, Atmospheric Environment, 164, pp. 85-101, (2017); Sung, Ukje, Planning strategies of wind corridor forests utilizing the properties of cold air, Land, 10, 6, (2021); Ng, Yan Yung Edward, Improving the wind environment in high-density cities by understanding urban morphology and surface roughness: A study in Hong Kong, Landscape and Urban Planning, 101, 1, pp. 59-74, (2011); Yang, Jun, Contribution of urban ventilation to the thermal environment and urban energy demand: Different climate background perspectives, Science of the Total Environment, 795, (2021); Kalnay, Eugenia E., Impact of urbanization and land-use change on climate, Nature, 423, 6939, pp. 528-531, (2003); He, Baojie, Enhancing urban ventilation performance through the development of precinct ventilation zones: A case study based on the Greater Sydney, Australia, Sustainable Cities and Society, 47, (2019); Urban Planning Forum, (2014); Rasouli, Ashkan, PIV measurements for a complex topographic terrain, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 97, 5-6, pp. 242-254, (2009); Guo, Fei, Detection and evaluation of a ventilation path in a mountainous city for a sea breeze: The case of Dalian, Building and Environment, 145, pp. 177-195, (2018); Urban Wind Environment Integrated Climate Sensitive Planning and Design, (2018)","J.

Diverse forms of data collected from sensors in areas of high activity in the urban environment, particularly at street intersections, are valuable resources for researchers interpreting the dynamics between vehicles, pedestrians, and the built environment. In this paper, we present a high-resolution audio, video, and LiDAR dataset of three urban intersections in Brooklyn, New York, totaling almost 8 unique hours. The data were collected with custom Reconfigurable Environmental Intelligence Platform (REIP) sensors that were designed with the ability to accurately synchronize multiple video and audio inputs. The resulting data are novel in that they are inclusively multimodal, multi-angular, high-resolution, and synchronized. We demonstrate four ways the data could be utilized — (1) to discover and locate occluded objects using multiple sensors and modalities, (2) to associate audio events with their respective visual representations using both video and audio modes, (3) to track the amount of each type of object in a scene over time, and (4) to measure pedestrian speed using multiple synchronized camera views. In addition to these use cases, our data are available for other researchers to carry out analyses related to applying machine learning to understanding the urban environment (in which existing datasets may be inadequate), such as pedestrian-vehicle interaction modeling and pedestrian attribute recognition. Such analyses can help inform decisions made in the context of urban sensing and smart cities, including accessibility-aware urban design and Vision Zero initiatives. © 2023 by the authors.",computer vision; data synchronization; street-level imagery; urban intelligence; urban multimedia data; urban sensing,Pedestrian safety; Synchronization; Urban planning; Data synchronization; High resolution; Multi-modal; Multimedia data; Street-level imagery; Urban design; Urban environments; Urban intelligence; Urban multimedium data; Urban sensing; Computer vision,,,,,"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA","This work was supported in part by CNS-1828576, CNS-1544753, CNS-1229185, CCF-1533564, CNS-1730396, and CNS-1626098.

A few municipalities have officially legalized both the selling and purchasing of sex, while others unofficially criminalize purchasing sex but have decriminalized its sale. In addition, there are many other locales with no official guidance on the subject but have unofficially decriminalized sex work by designating specific areas in an urban landscape safe from law enforcement for commercial sex, by quietly ceasing to arrest sex sellers, or by declining to prosecute anyone selling or attempting to sell sex. Despite these efforts, it remains crucial to understand where in an urban area commercial sex exchanges occur—legalization and decriminalization may result in fewer arrests but is likely to increase the overall size of the sex market. This growth could result in an increase in sex trafficking victimization, which makes up the majority of commercial sex sellers in any domestic market. Given the distribution of prostitution activities in most communities, it is possible to use high-fidelity predictive models to identify intervention opportunities related to sex trafficking victimization. In this research, we construct several machine learning models and inform them with a range of known criminogenic factors to predict locations hosting high levels of prostitution. We demonstrate these methods in the city of Chicago, Illinois. The results of this exploratory analysis identified a range of explanatory factors driving prostitution activity throughout Chicago, and the best-performing model correctly predicted prostitution frequency with 94% accuracy. We conclude by exploring specific areas of under- and over-prediction throughout Chicago and discuss the implications of these results for allocating social support efforts. © 2022 by the authors.",crime forecasting; logistic regression; machine learning; neural network; prostitution prediction; spatial analysis,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (2039917)",This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2039917.,"Predictive Policing the Role of Crime Forecasting in Law Enforcement Operations, (2013); Meijer, Albert Jacob, Predictive Policing: Review of Benefits and Drawbacks, International Journal of Public Administration, 42, 12, pp. 1031-1039, (2019); Area Specific Crime Prediction Models; Tom-Jack, Quincy T., The role of geoprocessing in mapping crime using hot streets, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 8, 12, (2019); Yi, Fei, An Integrated Model for Crime Prediction Using Temporal and Spatial Factors, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, 2018-November, pp. 1386-1391, (2018); Icpsr Interuniv Consort Political Soc Res, (2015); Andresen, Martin A., Spatially Varying Unemployment and Crime Effects in the Long Run and Short Run, Professional Geographer, 73, 2, pp. 297-311, (2021); Mohler, George O., Marked point process hotspot maps for homicide and gun crime prediction in Chicago, International Journal of Forecasting, 30, 3, pp. 491-497, (2014); Ohyama, Tomoya, Applying Crime Prediction Techniques to Japan: A Comparison Between Risk Terrain Modeling and Other Methods, European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research, 24, 4, pp. 469-487, (2018); Chen, Xinyu, Crime prediction using Twitter sentiment and weather, pp. 63-68, (2015)","E.

Little is known about the spatiotemporal variations and potential drivers of sentiment based on big data. A total of 221,104 Weibo social media data were used to quantify daily sentiment in the Beijing metropolitan area during the COVID-19 pandemic from January 1, 2021 to March 8, 2022. Deep-learning natural language processing was used to extract this dataset to investigate the spatiotemporal sentiment patterns. The density of roads and buildings, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population, sky visibility factor, daily land surface temperature (LST), daily precipitation, and daily air pollution concentrations (CO, NO<inf>2</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf>) were explored as potential drivers of sentiment. Results show that (1) the holiday sentiment was 1.31% higher than on weekends and 4.61% higher than on weekdays. Extreme precipitation, air pollution, and COVID-19 lockdown measures have reduced sentiment. (2) The sentiment in spring was found to be the highest. The numbers of functional zones with high sentiment values (>0.8) in spring were 13.59%, in summer 34.48%, and in autumn 14.71%. (3) Sentiment was highest under conditions of moderate greenness (0.4<NDVI<0.6) and comfortable daily temperature (25 °C < LST<30 °C).

First, the geospatial information carried by comments is analyzed by GIS to obtain the image structure of the city; second, the picture data in the comments are divided into image types and the type ratio is calculated by the image semantic segmentation method based on deep full convolution neural network. Finally, the text data in the comments are extracted from the semantic word frequency analysis to evaluate the cultural service perception index words of the city image and combined with the analysis of the city image structure and the city image type so as to obtain the integrated comprehensive perception of the city image. The research shows that the introduction of big data and deep learning methods into city image research can make up for the shortcomings of traditional research samples, expand the dimension and breadth of urban cognition, reveal the social, cultural, and functional characteristics of the city, and is an important supplement to the five-element model of city image depicting the material form of the city.

These elements also provide information during navigation—particularly for people with cognitive difficulties or those unfamiliar with the geographical area. Nevertheless, some urban components are less eye-catching than intended because they are created and positioned irrespective of their surroundings. While quantitative measures such as eye tracking have been introduced, they help the initial or final stage of the urban design process and they involve expensive experiments. We introduce machine-learning-predicted visual saliency as iterative feedback for pedestrian attention during urban element design. Our user study focused on wayfinding signs as part of urban design and revealed that providing saliency prediction promoted a more efficient and helpful design experience without compromising usability. The saliency-guided design practice also contributed to producing more eye-catching and aesthetically pleasing urban elements. The study demonstrated that visual saliency can lead to an improved urban design experience and outcome, resulting in more accessible cities for citizens, visitors, and people with cognitive impairments. © 2023 by the authors.",design feedback; urban planning; visual saliency; wayfinding design,aid; machine learning; pedestrian; urban design; urban planning; visual analysis,,,,,"Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, GIST; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20204010600340); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2021R1A4A1030075); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning, KETEP","This research was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the MSIT (2021R1A4A1030075), in part by the the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (No. 20204010600340), and in part by the GIST-MIT Research Collaboration grant funded by the GIST in 2023.","Caduff, David, On the assessment of landmark salience for human navigation, Cognitive Processing, 9, 4, pp. 249-267, (2008); Xu, Ran, Quantitative evaluation of BIPV visual impact in building retrofits using saliency models, Energies, 10, 5, (2017); Afacan, Yasemin, Elderly-friendly inclusive urban environments: Learning from Ankara, Open House International, 38, 1, pp. 52-63, (2013); Cognitive Processing, (2001); Passini, Romedi, Wayfinding design: Logic, application and some thoughts on universality, Design Studies, 17, 3, pp. 319-331, (1996); undefined, (2022); Zhang, Yunke, Quantifying the Causal Effect of Individual Mobility on Health Status in Urban Space, Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, 5, 4, (2021); Clare, Linda, Improving the experience of dementia and enhancing active life - living well with dementia: Study protocol for the IDEAL study, Health and Quality of Life Outcomes, 12, 1, (2014); Lee, Chunggi, GUIComp: A GUI Design Assistant with Real-Time, Multi-Faceted Feedback, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2020); Mitchell, Lynne, Neighbourhoods for life: Designing dementia-friendly outdoor environments, Quality in Ageing and Older Adults, 7, 1, pp. 26-33, (2006)","S.

To achieve these goals, a key role is played by all urban sectors, which can reduce environmental impacts and accelerate the green transition at larger scale. Intervening on a district scale obviously requires the evaluation of different aspects, taking into account both economic and non-economic criteria, as well as different points of view, involving all stakeholders. This paper proposes a multi-step evaluation procedure that extends the European manual-based Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to include the extra-economic benefits and the stakeholders’ opinion in the evaluation, according to the COmpoSIte Model for Assessment (COSIMA) method. This is the first application of COSIMA in the urban design sectors (i.e. buildings, water, public lighting, transportation and waste management) where different sustainable measures for a real case study located in Turin (Italy) were compared to define the most suitable transformation scenario according to multiple criteria. The results have shown how invasive scenarios allow achieving the greatest benefits, despite the huge initial costs of realization. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Decision support system (DSS); Multi-attribute value theory (MAVT); Simple multi-attribute rating technique extended (SMARTER); Urban sustainability,Artificial intelligence; Cost benefit analysis; COVID-19; Decision theory; Environmental impact; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Waste management; Built environment; Composite Modelling; Decision support system; Multi-attribute value theories; Multi-attribute value theory; Multi-attributes; Simple multi-attribute rating technique extended; Simple++; Sustainability project; Urban sustainability; Decision support systems,,,,,"European Commission, EC; Genome Institute of Singapore, GIS","The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is one of the main objectives worldwide. Not later than 2050, their reduction in Europe is recommended to be 80–95%, compared to the 1990 level (European Commission, 2011). Nowadays, urban areas are responsible for 70% of the total global emissions due to building and industrial sectors, followed by transport one. This is one of the main reasons why attention must be paid mainly to urban areas where human activities take place. The 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) defined by the United Nations stress on addressing climate change and building sustainable communities by 2030 (United Nations, 2017). SDGs 7 and 11 recognize the close link between cities and the energy sector to guarantee human well-being by reducing energy poverty and preserving the environment by reducing the effects of climate change. In this sense, many initiatives and new city concepts, such as Post-Carbon and Carbon Neutral Cities, were promoted to develop a more sustainable and resilient environment to tackle climate change (Nuñez et al., 2016). According to this new vision, all urban sectors can contribute to reducing emissions, and every possible action must be made from every side with an integrated approach. Climate change policies, improved energy efficiency and investment in renewables play a key role in addressing the volatility of energy prices that Europe has experienced in the recovery period after the COVID-19 outbreak (Li et al., 2022). To cope with the post-COVID-19 economic crisis, the European Commission has set up a resilience plan called Next Generation EU (NGEU) with a long-term financing plan of EUR 71 billion. Italy is the EU country that has benefited the most from NGEU funds. A large part of these funds will be spent to improve the country's green transition and have been included in the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NPRR) programme. To achieve progressive decarbonization, interventions have been planned to significantly increase the use of renewable energy sources, through direct investments and the simplification of authorisation procedures for renewables, and the reduction of energy demand in all urban sectors.There have been few studies on the theoretical and practical value of possible combinations of both techniques, particularly in the field of urban sustainability, energy and environmental policies. As suggested by Sanchez Martinez (2017), four already applied combinations of CBA and MCDA can be identified in the literature. The first category of approach is one in which the attributes of the MCDA are integrated within a CBA by monetizing them. This modification of attributes was done following the methodology proposed by Dones et al. (2005) in the External Costs of Energy (ExternE) project. The methodology involves an indirect monetization of the MCDA criteria based on the performance range of each criterion and the weight given to the performance of each criterion. This indirect evaluation is then added to the costs and benefits of the CBA, resulting in an extended CBA with elements that cannot be monetized a priori. The results of the application to the case study reveal the restrictive nature of the theoretical conditions that make the methodology hardly generalisable in terms of application. Moreover, with this approach, the obstacle of the difficulty of monetization characteristic of CBA is not overcome. The second approach involves integrating CBA profitability indicators (such as net present value, internal rate of return, benefit-cost ratio) into an MCDA-based decision support framework. This approach allows for a synthetic indicator, but it does not have the possibility to differentiate between tangible and intangible impacts. Napoli et al. (2020) integrate investment costs, Net Present Value (NPV) and payback period as criteria of an evaluation based on the ELECTRE TRI-nC method to cluster a set of alternative energy upgrading projects. This alternative is illustrated by Gühnemann et al. (2012) for the evaluation of a road infrastructure improvement investment scheme in Ireland.The proposed methodology adopts a multi-step approach (Fig. 1). Firstly, the energy (i.e. annual primary energy consumption) and environmental performances (i.e. annual CO2eq emissions and annual water consumptions) of the district in current and project scenarios are estimated, considering the following sectors: residential building, water (referred to usage in buildings), public and private transport, public lighting, and waste management. To this end, the state of affairs (SOA) of each sector is analyzed and characterized thanks to different databases and sources. In particular, the collection and management of spatial data can be supported by GIS (Abbasabadi and Mehdi Ashayeri, 2019). Different approaches are used to model SOA scenario for the identified urban sectors (Section 3.1). Once the SOA is set, sustainability measures (SMs) are defined for the different urban sectors, combined in actions and, subsequently, in different alternative scenarios, which are assessed, above all, in terms of their energy and environmental performance.","Abastante, Francesca, District energy choices: More than a monetary problem. a SDSS approach to define urban energy scenarios, Valori e Valutazioni, 2019, 22, pp. 109-120, (2019); Abbasabadi, Narjes, Urban energy use modeling methods and tools: A review and an outlook, Building and Environment, 161, (2019); Akin, Darçin, Multicriteria analysis of planned intercity bus terminals in the metropolitan city of Istanbul, Turkey, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 132, pp. 465-489, (2020); Ambrasaite, Inga, MCDA and risk analysis in transport infrastructure appraisals: The Rail Baltica case, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 20, pp. 944-953, (2011); Ballarini, Ilaria, Use of reference buildings to assess the energy saving potentials of the residential building stock: The experience of TABULA project, Energy Policy, 68, pp. 273-284, (2014); Barfod, Michael Bruhn, A new composite decision support framework for strategic and sustainable transport appraisals, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 72, pp. 1-15, (2015); Barfod, Michael Bruhn, Examination of decision support systems for composite CBA and MCDA assessments of transport infrastructure projects, Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, 648, pp. 167-176, (2011); Barfod, Michael Bruhn, Composite decision support by combining cost-benefit and multi-criteria decision analysis, Decision Support Systems, 51, 1, pp. 167-175, (2011); Barron, F.

Reliable and up-to-date information on urban vegetation is therefore needed as a basis for sustainable urban design and regular tasks such as vegetation maintenance. Mobile laser scanning (MLS), i. e., the use of vehicle-mounted laser scanners, offers strong potential for capturing 3D point clouds of road environments on a large scale at a low cost. In this paper, the potential and challenges of using MLS for vegetation mapping are discussed. To lay a foundation for MLS-based inventories of roadside vegetation, a concept for the automatic detection and analysis of vegetation in MLS point clouds using deep learning is presented. The proposed workflow covers vegetation detection and classification, delineation of individual trees, and estimation of tree attributes. In a case study, an initial implementation of the work-flow is tested using MLS datasets from two German cities and the results are evaluated through visual inspection. It is demonstrated that the proposed deep-learning approach is able to detect and classify vegetation in MLS point clouds of complex urban road scenes. When delineating individual trees, accurate results are obtained for solitary trees and trees with little canopy overlap, while the delineation of trees with strongly overlapping canopies needs further improvement in some cases.

We illustrate the merits of our approach by explaining computer vision models used to analyse street imagery, which are now widely used in GeoAI and urban analytics. Such explanations are important in urban analytics as researchers and practioners are increasingly reliant on it for decision making. Finally, we perform a user study that demonstrate our approach can be used by non-expert users, who might not be machine learning experts, to be more confident and to better understand the behaviour of image-based classifiers/regressors for street view analysis. Furthermore, the method can potentially be used as an engagement tool to visualise how public spaces can plausibly look like. The limited realism of the counterfactuals is a concern which we hope to improve in the future. © 2023 The Author(s).

This research aims to identify the microclimatic dissimilarities between courtyards in terms of tempering seasonal–diurnal thermal extremes and enriching ground-level thermal textures. The methodology included field measurements in summer-2021 and winter-2022 in Cambridge, UK; microclimatic simulations of 107 courtyards in ENVI-met and model validations; and machine learning-driven clustering using Super Organising Maps (SuperSOM). The results indicate that the diurnal thermal range of the spatial-UTCI mean in summer (DTR(M)<24∘C) is double that in winter (DTR(M)<12∘C); meanwhile the maximum spatial-UTCI deviation is three times as significant (δ>3∘Cat 7:00 BST versus δ>1∘Cat 12:00 GMT). SuperSOM analysis was performed using K-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering to partition all courtyards into seven subclusters on its graph-lattice structure. Clusters Km_I, Hac_I, and Hac_IV feature a positive synergy between the thermal-tempering and thermal-enriching potentials. In contrast, the other four clusters exhibit conflicting scenarios during the day and night across the two seasons analysed. These data-driven outcomes enabled us to optimise spatial and landscape strategies for designing and retrofitting courtyard microclimates, contributing to the current discussions on climate-responsive and sensation-inclusive design in historical urban contexts. © 2022 The Author(s)",Courtyard; Historical urban contexts; Machine learning; Microclimate; Thermal diversity; Thermal tempering,Concentration (process); K-means clustering; Tempering; Textures; Cambridge; Courtyard; Historical urban context; Machine-learning; Microclimate; Performance; Thermal; Thermal diversity; Thermal tempering; Urban context; Machine learning; climate modeling; ground-based measurement; machine learning; microclimate; model validation; performance assessment; strategic approach; temperature profile; urban climate; urban design; urban planning; Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; Cambridgeshire; England; United Kingdom,,,,,,"Funding text 1: We would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the time and effort devoted by the editors and reviewers to improving the quality of this published work.

Some firms are located close to wealthy neighborhoods and far from competitors, but other firms do not enjoy these advantages. The probability that a household selects a certain firm to patronize depends on that firm’s price and its distance from the household. The firms have almost no information about the urban market they inhabit, but they can experiment with prices and learn what actions lead to higher profits. Firms that experience persistent losses go out of business. When transportation costs are low, households shop aggressively and the result that emerges resembles perfect competition. When transportation costs are high, households shop less aggressively, which gives firms greater market power. The results here more closely resemble monopolistic competition, with more firms surviving, higher prices and higher profits. However, this collusion is implicit, as there is no mechanism for the firms to communicate or explicitly collude with each other. I validate the model by conducting a Probit analysis of the factors that determine firm survival. I also conduct an econometric analysis of the factors that determine a firm’s price, quantity sold, and profit. Firms locating close to rival have a higher probability of going out of business. If these firms do survive, on average their profits are no different than the profits of firms that are not located close to a rival. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Agent-based simulations; Firm location; Firm survival; Machine learning; Urban retail markets,,,,,,,The author wishes to thank Steven O.

This study investigates the impact of LU/LC class changes on LST based on the distribution of UHI spot maps in Mansoura city, Egypt, using Landsat satellite images from 1991 to 2021. Based on these estimated LU/LC and LST maps, machine learning algorithms, cellular automata, and artificial neural network approaches were used to predict future changes in LU/LC and LST for 2031. The influence of UHI may be quantified using the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). The geographic information system (GIS) add-in UHI calculator ArcGIS tool was created because we considered the spatial consequences of employing remote sensing data. This tool includes all the methods and procedures for calculating LST and UHI. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between LST and normalized difference built-up index and a negative correlation between LST and normalized difference vegetation index. The forecasted results for 2031 also show that the built-up area will grow roughly 20%, with a considerable drop in vegetation by 18%. If the city's fast urbanization continues, more than 40% of Mansoura will have land surface temperatures above 45°C by 2031. Avoiding dense built-up areas and growing vegetation spaces remain efficient means of minimizing the influence of UTFVI in urban construction practice. Therefore, this research will help to achieve sustainable development by providing essential insights into the complicated interplay between diverse aspects of urban settings and promoting city competency. © Geoinformatics International.",Artificial Neural Network; Land Surface Temperature; Machine Learning; Prediction; Urban Heat Island,algorithm; ArcGIS; automation; climate effect; heat island; land cover; land surface; land use change; machine learning; mapping method; satellite imagery; surface temperature; sustainable development; urban climate; urban design; urban development; vegetation cover; Egypt; Mansoura,,,,,,,"Global Megatrends Mapping the Forces that Affect Us all, (2020); Kleemann, Janina, Assessing driving forces of land use and land cover change by a mixed-method approach in north-eastern Ghana, West Africa, Journal of Environmental Management, 196, pp. 411-442, (2017); Bratley, Kelsee H., Modeling urban encroachment on the agricultural land of the Eastern Nile Delta using remote sensing and a GIS-Based Markov Chain Model, Land, 7, 4, (2018); Hatab, Assem Abu, Urban sprawl, food security and agricultural systems in developing countries: A systematic review of the literature, Cities, 94, pp. 129-142, (2019); Sonnino, Roberta, The new geography of food security: Exploring the potential of urban food strategies, Geographical Journal, 182, 2, pp. 190-200, (2016); Bokaie, Mehdi, Assessment of Urban Heat Island based on the relationship between land surface temperature and Land Use/ Land Cover in Tehran, Sustainable Cities and Society, 23, pp. 94-104, (2016); El-Hattab, Mamdouh M., Monitoring and assessment of urban heat islands over the Southern region of Cairo Governorate, Egypt, Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Science, 21, 3, pp. 311-323, (2018); Kafy, Abdulla Al, Predicting the impacts of land use/land cover changes on seasonal urban thermal characteristics using machine learning algorithms, Building and Environment, 217, (2022); Najafzadeh, Faezeh, Spatial and temporal analysis of surface urban heat island and thermal comfort using landsat satellite images between 1989 and 2019: A case study in tehran, Remote Sensing, 13, 21, (2021); Vapnik, Vladimir N., On the uniform convergence of relative frequencies of events to their probabilities, pp. 11-30, (2015)","S.

Food-related urbanism has been investigated for decades to explore how food access influences placemaking and urban forms. With global climate change, foodscapes within urban spaces are an important consideration in urban design and planning for food security and community health. The distribution of catering businesses (restaurants and cafés), one critical method of access to food, is highly associated with urban spaces because of their high impact on diet patterns, human physical activities, travel behaviors, and the use of public spaces. This research explores the spatial associations that exist between the distribution of catering businesses and the design and planning of urban spaces in London. This quantitative research includes three parts: (1) uses Open Street Map data and the GIS spatial analysis method to study the distribution of catering businesses; (2) uses the imagery segmentation method in machine learning to categorize urban spaces into open, landscape, and conflict spaces; and (3) establishes the association between the distribution of catering businesses and the categories of urban spaces through Spearman’s correlation and a linear regression model. The results indicate that the spatial distributions of catering businesses are highly correlated with urban spaces. Conflict and landscape spaces have a significant positive influence on the distribution of catering businesses, while open space has a significant negative influence. Based on the context of global climate change, this research contributes a quantitative urban design and planning approach to promote access to food increase food options and advocate active lifestyles. © 2022 by the authors.",computer vision; data-driven; food access; regression model; urban space,Climate change; Food supply; Image segmentation; Linear regression; Urban planning; Data driven; Data segmentation; Design and planning; Food access; Global climate changes; Images segmentations; Regression modelling; Spatial associations; Urban design; Urban spaces; Computer vision; accessibility; business; computer vision; food industry; GIS; image analysis; Internet; regression analysis; segmentation; spatial distribution; urban planning; England; London [England]; United Kingdom,,,,,,,"Pielke, Roger A., A new paradigm for assessing the role of agriculture in the climate system and in climate change, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 142, 2-4, pp. 234-254, (2007); Parham, Susan, Exploring food and urbanism, Journal of Urbanism, 13, 1, pp. 1-12, (2020); Moragues-Faus, Ana M., Reframing the foodscape: the emergent world of urban food policy, Environment and Planning A, 47, 7, pp. 1558-1573, (2015); Hanser, Amy, Good Food in the City: How Cultural Ideas About Food Shape Street Vending Regulation, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 45, 3, pp. 519-534, (2021); International Journal of Architecture and Urban Development, (2013); Frank, Lawrence Douglas, Comparing walkability methods: Creation of street smart walk score and efficacy of a code-based 3D walkability index, Journal of Transport and Health, 21, (2021); Ewing, Reid H., Measuring the unmeasurable: Urban design qualities related to walkability, Journal of Urban Design, 14, 1, pp. 65-84, (2009); London Food Strategy Healthy and Sustainable Food for London, (2018); A Crisis within A Crisis the Impact of Covid 19 on Household Food Security, (2021); Liu, Kang, Visualizing and exploring POI configurations of urban regions on POI-type semantic space, Cities, 99, (2020)","M.

We present a new technique for probabilistic precipitation nowcasting by generating an ensemble of equiprobable forecasts, which is especially useful for weather radars with limited spatial range, and that can be used operationally on devices with low computational capacity. The ensemble members are obtained by a novel stochastic noise generation process, consistent with the spatial scales not resolved by the prediction model, which allows continuous downscaling of the output of a deep generative neural network. Through an in-depth analysis of the results, for precipitation accumulated in the first hour, measured by all the most robust skill indicators, extended to an entire year of data at 5-min time resolution, we demonstrate that the proposed procedure is able to provide calibrated, reliable, and sharp ensemble rainfall forecasts with a quality comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art classical alternative optical flow technique. The ensemble generation procedure we propose is sufficiently general to be applied in principle to other deterministic architectures as well, thus enabling their generalization in probabilistic terms. © 2022 by the authors.",deep learning; generative neural network; meteorological radar data; optical flow; probabilistic nowcast; spatial downscaling,,,,,,Regione Autonoma della Sardegna,"This research was funded by the Tessuto Digitale Metropolitano (TDM) project with funds provided by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, through Action 1.2.2 of the POR FESR Sardinia 2014–2020.","Bulletin, (2019); Ayzel, Georgy V., Optical flow models as an open benchmark for radar-based precipitation nowcasting (rainymotion v0.1), Geoscientific Model Development, 12, 4, pp. 1387-1402, (2019); Dixon, Michael J., TITAN: thunderstorm identification, tracking, analysis, and nowcasting - a radar-based methodology, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 10, 6, pp. 785-797, (1993); Chang, Paoliang, An operational multi-radar multi-sensor QPE system in Taiwan, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 102, 3, pp. 555-577, (2021); Smith, K.

This paper takes a typical mixed-use developed city, Adelaide, as an example and demonstrates a complete workflow (data collection, data pairing, model training, model interpretation, and model application) using machine learning algorithms to better understand the relationships between urban morphology and solar potential at an urban neighborhood (meso-level) scale. The artificial neural network model has the highest accuracy, and six urban morphology indicators (building density, plot ration, building height, building floors, variance of height, and variance of volume) are shown to be influential in predicting urban solar potential. The model also reflects the interaction between urban morphological indicators and their nonlinear impact. Futhermore, five typical morphological prototypes are identified. The average solar potential of Cluster 1 is 1402.53 kWh/m2/year, 4.3% higher than Cluster 3, 11.2% higher than Cluster 4, 21.2% higher than Cluster 2, and 36.8% higher than Cluster 5.

However, a majority of recommendations summarized by scholars for promoting TODs through urban design have failed to promote the progress of the urban design. The main reason for this issue is the long-standing tradition of design decision-making based on designers’ experience and the lack of quantitative assessment feedback on design schemes. With the development of big data and artificial intelligence, optimisation-based generative design has been explored to overcome the limitations of experience-based urban design approaches. However, the techniques and workflows are still not mature enough for designers to adopt. In response to these challenges, this study proposes a framework that integrates the generative design method and data-driven decision-making approach for urban design solutions that better implement the basic principles of TODs. Based on the urban design intelligence for TODs, this framework uses parametric tools and models to evaluate the generative urban design proposals, providing timely feedback to support the design decisions. The framework is applied to a case study to examine the feasibility. It is demonstrated that this approach succeeds in selecting optimal TOD design solutions. The role of designers’ decision-making in generative urban design, as well as the importance of quantitative and qualitative assessment in experience-based decision-making, are highlighted. © 2022 by the authors.",activity-based model; amenity accessibility; evidence-based design decision-making; generative urban design; transit-oriented development; walkability,,,,,,"(KM202210009008); Australian Research Council, ARC, (LP190100089); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52208039); North China University of Technology, NCUT; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFF0304900)","This project is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [52208039], the National key R&D program “Science and Technology Winter Olympics” key project “Evacuation system and support technology for assisting physically challenged communities” [2020YFF0304900], the Beijing High-level Overseas Talents Support Funding, R&D Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (KM202210009008), the NCUT Young Scholar Development Project, and the Australian Research Council Linkage Project [LP190100089].","Transit Oriented Development, (2020); Ibraeva, Anna, Transit-oriented development: A review of research achievements and challenges, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 132, pp. 110-130, (2020); Cervero, Robert B., Travel choices in pedestrian versus automobile oriented neighborhoods, Transport Policy, 3, 3, pp. 127-141, (1996); Currie, Graham, Investigating links between social capital and public transport, Transport Reviews, 28, 4, pp. 529-547, (2008); Kamruzzaman, Liton (Md), Patterns of social capital associated with transit oriented development, Journal of Transport Geography, 35, pp. 144-155, (2014); Regional City Planning for the End of Sprawl, (2001); Transforming Cities with Transit Transit and Land Use Integration for Sustainable Urban Development, (2013); Journal of Transport and Land Use, (2008); Good City Form, (1981); New Transit Town Best Practices in Transit Oriented Development, (2004)","X.

In addition, available public participation computational tools focus mainly on information and idea sharing, leaving the public excluded in design generation because of their lack of design expertise. To address such an issue, this study develops Urban-GAN, a plural urban design computation system, to provide new technical support for design empowerment, allowing the public to generate their own designs. The sub-symbolic representation and artificial intelligence techniques of deep convolutional neural networks, case-based reasoning, and generative adversarial networks are used to acquire and embody design knowledge as the density function, and generate design schemes with this knowledge. The system consists of an urban form database and five process models through which the user with little design expertise can select urban form cases, generate designs similar to those cases, and make design decisions. The Urban-GAN is applied to hypothetical design experiments, which show that the user is able to apply the system to successfully generate distinctive designs following the urban form “styles” in Manhattan, Portland, and Shanghai.

While previous research has identified that the composition of urban landscapes influences the physical properties of the environment such as surface temperature, a generalizable and flexible framework is needed that can be used to compare cities across time and space. This study employs the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) classification combined with remote sensing of New York City’s land surface temperature (LST). These are then linked using machine learning and statistical modeling to identify how greenspace and the built environment influence urban surface temperature. Further, changes in urban structure are then connected to changes in LST over time. It was observed that areas with urban units composed of largely the built environment hosted the hottest temperatures while those with vegetation and water were coolest. Likewise, this is reinforced by borough-level spatial differences in both urban structure and heat. Comparison of these relationships over the period between 2008 and 2017 identified changes in surface temperature that are likely due to the changes in the presence of water, low-rise buildings, and pavement across the city.

Planning the best path of urban greenery is a means to effectively maximize the use of urban greenery, which plays a positive role in the physical and mental health of urban residents and the path planning of visitors. In this paper, we used Google street view to obtain street view images of Osaka City. The semantic segmentation model is adopted to segment the street view images and analyze the green view index (GVI) of Osaka City. Based on the GVI, we take advantage of the adjacency matrix and Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate GVI best path, solving the limitations of ArcGIS software. Our analysis not only allows the calculation of specific routes for the GVI best paths but also realizes the visualization and integration of neighborhood urban greenery. By summarizing all the data, we can conduct an intuitive feeling and objective analysis of the street-level greenery in the research area. Based on this, such as urban residents and visitors can maximize the available natural resources for a better life.

However, most empirical studies fail to consider emotion-oriented landscape assessments under dynamic perspectives despite the fact that individually observed sceneries alter with angle. To close this gap, a real-time sentimental-based landscape assessment framework is developed, integrating facial expression recognition with semantic segmentation of changing landscapes. Furthermore, a case study using panoramic videos converted from Google Street View images to simulate changing scenes was used to test the viability of this framework, resulting in five million big data points. The result of this study shows that through the collaboration of deep learning algorithms, finer visual variables were classified, subtle emotional responses were tracked, and better regression results for valence and arousal were obtained. Among all the predictors, the proportion of grass was the most significant predictor for emotional perception. The proposed framework is adaptable and human-centric, and it enables the instantaneous emotional perception of the built environment by the general public as a feedback survey tool to aid urban planners in creating UGS that promote emotional well-being. © 2022 by the authors.",deep learning; facial expression recognition; landscape assessment; semantic segmentation; urban green space,greenspace; health impact; machine learning; perception; public attitude; urban design; algorithm; arousal; article; big data; built environment; deep learning; emotion; emotional stability; emotional well-being; facial recognition; grass; human; human experiment; nonhuman; videorecording; physiology; semantics; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Emotions; Facial Recognition; Humans; Semantics,,,,,,,"Benzell, Seth G., Rationing social contact during the COVID-19 pandemic: Transmission risk and social benefits of US locations, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117, 26, pp. 14642-14644, (2020); Tobías, Aurelio, Evaluation of the lockdowns for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy and Spain after one month follow up, Science of the Total Environment, 725, (2020); Leigh-Hunt, Nicholas, An overview of systematic reviews on the public health consequences of social isolation and loneliness, Public Health, 152, pp. 157-171, (2017); Smith, Kimberley J., Typologies of loneliness, living alone and social isolation, and their associations with physical and mental health, Ageing and Society, 39, 8, pp. 1709-1730, (2019); Gascon, Mireia, Outdoor blue spaces, human health and well-being: A systematic review of quantitative studies, International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health, 220, 8, pp. 1207-1221, (2017); Kondo, Michelle C., Urban green space and its impact on human health, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 3, (2018); Meuwese, Daphne, Beating the blues by viewing Green: Depressive symptoms predict greater restoration from stress and negative affect after viewing a nature video, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 75, (2021); Pouso, Sarai, Contact with blue-green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown beneficial for mental health, Science of the Total Environment, 756, (2021); Yang, Ying, Viewing nature scenes reduces the pain of social ostracism, Journal of Social Psychology, pp. 1-19, (2020); Nordh, Helena, Tracking Restorative Components: Patterns in Eye Movements as a Consequence of a Restorative Rating Task, Landscape Research, 38, 1, pp. 101-116, (2013)","Y.

Urban parks generally may enhance people's positive sentiments, but little is known about explicitly linking the landscape composition and configuration of urban parks directly with visitors' sentiments based on social media data. The main objective of this study, therefore, was to identify key landscape attributes that influence this relationship in the Beijing metropolitan region. We first crawled 55,441 valid text data items from Sina Weibo for 99 urban parks within the fifth ring road of Beijing. Then, we quantified the positive emotions of visitors to urban parks using social media data and sentiment analysis. Finally, we evaluated the differences in visitors' positive emotions among different types of parks and used Random Forest to identify urban park attributes that were correlated with positive emotions. We found that visitors to different types of urban parks had different levels of positive emotions. Specifically, visitors to comprehensive parks and cultural relics parks were significantly happier than visitors to community parks. Visitors to parks between the third and fourth ring roads in Beijing had the lowest levels of positive emotions. Positive emotions were found to be positively correlated with park size and the mean size of water bodies but negatively correlated with large areas of impervious surfaces. This study sheds new light on the relationship between park landscape patterns and visitors' positive emotions through a new approach based on social media data. The research methods and findings may inspire similar studies in other cities and countries, which are needed to improve park planning and management and thus enhance urban sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Big data; Cultural services; Deep learning; Ecosystem services; Green and blue spaces; Human well-being; Urban landscape sustainability,social media; Beijing [China]; China,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41871185, 41971271); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2014CB954303, 2019YFA0607203); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFA0607203), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41871185&41971271), and the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954303).","Ambrose, Graham, Is gardening associated with greater happiness of urban residents?

However, there is uncertainty about which urban heat mitigation strategies (UHMSs) can provide better solutions for a specific urban context. There is a compelling need for local governments to automate the decision-making process and optimise the combination of UHMSs to maximise the mitigation outcomes for their cities. We develop a novel decision-making framework that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into urban heat mitigation in the built environment to enable an automated process of decision making. The novel decision-making framework comprises: the ontology-based knowledge representation of UHMSs and their relationships with urban contexts and performance assessment to share knowledge in urban heat mitigation domain; sensitivity analysis of the environmental, social and economic performance of UHMSs to get key variables for UHMSs; and genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimisation of UHMSs. The novel decision-making framework enables generating the context-based optimised UHMS combinations to support local governments’ decision-making. The research outcomes will advance interdisciplinary knowledge about using AI techniques in the decision-making process for urban heat mitigation. © 2022","Multi-objective optimisation; Sensitive planning and design variables; Urban contexts, Ontology; Urban heat mitigation strategies","Automation; Behavioral research; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Sensitivity analysis; Context ontology; Decision-making frameworks; Design variables; Mitigation strategy; Multi-objectives optimization; Planning and design; Sensitive planning and design variable; Urban context; Urban context, ontology; Urban heat mitigation strategy; Multiobjective optimization; artificial intelligence; decision making; genetic algorithm; knowledge; local government; optimization; planning process; urban design; urban planning; article; built environment; government; heat; human; multiobjective optimization; ontology; sensitivity analysis",,,,,,,"Alexandri, Eleftheria, Temperature decreases in an urban canyon due to green walls and green roofs in diverse climates, Building and Environment, 43, 4, pp. 480-493, (2008); undefined, (2018); PLEA 2013 29th Conference Sustainable Architecture for A Renewable Future Munich Germany, (2013); Chow, Winston T.L., Observing and modeling the nocturnal park cool island of an arid city: Horizontal and vertical impacts, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 103, 1, pp. 197-211, (2011); de Freitas, Christopher R., A comparison and appraisal of a comprehensive range of human thermal climate indices, International Journal of Biometeorology, 61, 3, pp. 487-512, (2017); undefined, (2019); undefined, (2019); Ene, Seval, A genetic algorithm for minimizing energy consumption in warehouses, Energy, 114, pp. 973-980, (2016); Field, Christopher B., Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation: Special report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, 9781107025066, pp. 1-582, (2012); Multiobjective Genetic Algorithms with Application to Control Engineering Problems, (1995)","J.

Although characterizing landscape to protect landscape diversity is widely used in regional landscape and preservation practices, it is difficult to apply to urban landscape character assessment, which needs fine-scale data support, explicit study units, and effective clustering models. Therefore, this study uses urban big geospatial data and machine learning technology to establish a technical system for character assessment of urban landscape applicable to the block scale and complete the landscape assessment of urban areas of Beijing and Shanghai, China. A total of 64 landscape character types were identified in Beijing, and 61 in Shanghai. We find that (1) urban landscape characters are different with the ring road as the boundary, but each zone presents a combination of different proportions of landscape characters. (2) Beijing's city wall demolition policy is affected by historical protection policy. Landscape differentiation on both sides of the Huangpu River in Shanghai has yet to be realized. This study extends the theory of LCA and realizes the research exploration of urban built environment.

However, the usage and user experiences of greenways are often challenging to measure because it is costly to survey such large areas. Based on the online postings from Instagram in 2017, this paper used Computer Vision (CV) technology to analyze and compare how the general public uses two typical greenway parks, The High Line in New York City and the Atlanta Beltline in Atlanta. Face and object detection analysis were conducted to infer user composition, activities, and key experiences. We presented the temporal patterns of Instagram postings as well as the group gatherings, smiling, and representative objects detected from photos. Our results have shown high user engagement levels for both parks while teens are significantly underrepresented. The High Line had more group activities and was more active during weekdays than the Atlanta Beltline. Stronger sense of escape and physical activities can be found in Atlanta Beltline. In summary, social media images like Instagram can provide strong empirical evidence for urban greenway usage when combined with artificial intelligence technologies, which can support the future practice of landscape architecture and urban design. © The Author(s) 2022.",computer vision; park usage; place quality; social media; Urban greenway,artificial intelligence; comparative study; computer vision; greenspace; social media; temporal variation; urban area; Atlanta; Georgia; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (OAC-2112356, SMA-2122054); National Science Foundation, NSF; Texas A and M University, TAMU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants SMA-2122054 and OAC-2112356, Texas A&M University Harold L.

Fulton Schools of Engineering, Tempe, AZ, United States","The efficacy of urban mitigation strategies for heat and carbon emissions relies heavily on local urban characteristics. The continuous development and improvement of urban land surface models enable rather accurate assessment of the environmental impact on urban development strategies, whereas physically-based simulations remain computationally costly and time consuming, as a consequence of the increasing complexity of urban system dynamics. Hence it is imperative to develop fast, efficient, and economic operational toolkits for urban planners to foster the design, implementation, and evaluation of urban mitigation strategies, while retaining the accuracy and robustness of physical models. In this study, we adopt a machine learning (ML) algorithm, viz. Gaussian Process Regression, to emulate the physics of heat and biogenic carbon exchange in the built environment. The ML surrogate is trained and validated on the simulation results generated by a state-of-the-art single-layer urban canopy model over a wide range of urban characteristics, showing high accuracy in capturing heat and carbon dynamics. Using the validated surrogate model, we then conduct multi-objective optimization using the genetic algorithm to optimize urban design scenarios for desirable urban mitigation effects. While the use of urban greenery is found effective in mitigating both urban heat and carbon emissions, there is manifest trade-offs among ameliorating diverse urban environmental indicators. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon dioxide emission; Environmental system dynamics; Machine learning; Urban heat mitigation; Urban system planning,Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Planning; System theory; Urban growth; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Environmental system dynamic; Heat emission; Mitigation strategy; Multi-objectives optimization; System planning; Urban heat mitigation; Urban system planning; Urban systems; Global warming; carbon emission; heat island; machine learning; multiobjective programming; optimization; urban design; urban planning,,,,,"(DEB-1637590); National Science Foundation, NSF, (AGS-1930629, CBET-2028868, CISE-1931297, GEO-2044051); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC20K1263); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, (NA20OAR4310341); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA","This study is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants AGS-1930629 , CBET-2028868 , GEO-2044051 , and CISE-1931297 , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under grant # 80NSSC20K1263 , and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under grant NA20OAR4310341 .

It is often regarded as an indicator of social justice. However, due to the difficulties in obtaining green space exposure data from a ground-based view, an effective evaluation of the green space exposure inequity at the community level remains challenging. In this study, we presented a green space exposure inequity assessment framework, integrating the Green View Index (GVI), deep learning, spatial statistical analysis methods, and urban rental price big data to analyze green space exposure inequity at the community level toward a “15-minute city” in Zhengzhou, China. The results showed that green space exposure inequality is evident among residential communities. The areas in the old city were with relatively high GVI and the new city districts were with relatively low GVI. Moreover, a spatially uneven association was observed between the degree of green space exposure and housing prices. Especially, the wealthier communities in the new city districts benefit from low green space, compared to disadvantaged communities in the old city. The findings provide valuable insights for policy and planning to effectively implement greening strategies and eliminate environmental inequality in urban areas. © 2022 by the authors.

Due to the limitations in available data and technologies, existing hedonic studies mainly capture accessibility to green space (i.e., proximity), and how visual contact with green space (i.e., visibility) impacts housing prices is not well understood. This paper measures the intangible concept of visual contact with green space by taking advantage of street view images and community photos based on semantic segmentation. Then, based on hedonic model theory, a set of housing price determinants is selected. Finally, we construct two models, namely, random forest regression and geographically weighted regression models, to explore the capitalization effects of visual contact with green space on housing prices in Shenzhen, China. In our study, compared with indicators such as park accessibility and greening rate, variables of green visual contact are more important for housing prices. Moreover, the effects of visual contact with green space inside and outside the community display marked spatial variations. This work is a beneficial attempt to focus on the human scale for the actual demand of urban green planning. The findings of this paper add further knowledge to highlight the importance of visual contact with green space in street design and urban planning, which can enrich research on the amenity values of green space and the quality of public space theoretically and methodologically. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Green space; GWR; Housing price; Random forest; Visual contact,greenspace; hedonic analysis; housing market; integrated approach; machine learning; perception; price dynamics; urban design; urban planning; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41901326); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (21SHC005, BK20190742); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, NUPT, (NY219036); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, NUPT","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41901326 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( BK20190742 ), Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( 21SHC005 ), the Scientific Research foundation of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications ( NY219036 ).","Badrinarayanan, Vijay, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Campbell, Andrew, Detecting and mapping traffic signs from Google Street View images using deep learning and GIS, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 77, (2019); Chen, Yimin, Mapping the fine-scale spatial pattern of housing rent in the metropolitan area by using online rental listings and ensemble learning, Applied Geography, 75, pp. 200-212, (2016); Chen, Yang, Which communities have better accessibility to green space?

However, due to the limitation of precision of equipment, there are big gaps to collect high-resolution DEM data. A practical idea is to recover high-resolution DEMs from easily obtained low-resolution DEMs, and this process is termed DEM super-resolution (SR). However, traditional DEM SR methods (e.g., bicubic interpolation) tend to over-smooth high-frequency regions on account of the operation of averaging local variations. With the recent development of machine learning, image SR methods have made great progress. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of terrain characters (e.g., peak and valley) and the huge difference between elevation field and image RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) value field, there are few works that apply image SR methods to the task of DEM SR. Therefore, this paper investigates the question of whether the state-of-the-art image SR methods are appropriate for DEM SR. More specifically, the traditional interpolation method and three excellent SR methods based on neural networks are chosen for comparison. Experimental results suggest that SRGAN (Super-Resolution with Generative Adversarial Network) presents the best performance on accuracy evaluation over a series of DEM SR experiments. © 2022 by the authors.

Then the generation mechanism of the local characteristics was discussed. The results show that the cities in the two countries show significant differences, whereas some cities in the basin are similar. The images of the ‘Built Environment' and ‘Social Life' are more conducive to identifying the cities. The construction qualities of ‘Remains' and ‘Water' are the key built environmental factors for the coexistence of locality differences and similarities. The protection of historic buildings and less manual intervention in the water environment are of great significance to the local shaping of German cities and have reference value for developing Chinese cities.

For this, we used deep learning to quantify the distribution of physical elements and their spatial composition and a spatial clustering analysis to uncover hidden patterns in the streetscapes. These methodologies enabled us to assess streets across neighborhoods and districts and produce a comparative microscale analysis that covers a wider area.

It is well known for its ethnic and prehistoric culture, folk songs, rare stones, and urban landscape. The demand of tourism in Liuzhou city is increasing day by day. Therefore, a system is needed to accurately predict the increasing demand of tourism in Liuzhou city. For this reason, based on the examination of historical visitor data in natural sites especially in Liuzhou city, this research employs an important machine learning and deep learning approach. The purpose of this study is to identify the consumption patterns and improve prediction, prejudgment, and preparation abilities by incorporating them into an intelligent tourism service platform, preventing visitors from travelling at inconvenient times and providing appropriate suggestions to scenic site managers. In this paper, the Sparse Principal Component Analysis-Long-Short-Term Memory (SPCA-LSTM) model has been updated to the Sparse Principal Component Analysis Convolutional Neural Network Long-Short-Term Memory (SPCA-CNNLSTM) model to accurately predict the tourist traffic during the holidays. Convolutional and pooling layers are added to the network topology to extract the local characteristics of the input data. The data of passenger traffic and influencing factors of Liuzhou scenic area from the months of Sept. 2015 to Nov. 2019 were used as the data set for the experiments. A hybrid-forecasting model is also proposed in the paper, which first removes noise from international crude oil data using compression-aware denoising preprocessing and then combines compression-aware denoising with machine learning using artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR). The experimental result shows that the SPCA-CNNLSTM model predicts better values than the SPCA-LSTM model. © 2022 Wenqing Li.",,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Convolutional neural network; De-noising; Folk songs; Machine-learning; Memory modeling; On-machines; Region-based; Sparse principal component analysis; Tourism demand; Urban landscape; Long short-term memory,,,,,,,"Wang, Meiyu, Forecast and Application of GA Optimization BP Neural Network Tourism Demand in High-speed Railway Era, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 569, 4, (2019); Lu, Qikai, Retrieval of water quality from uav-borne hyperspectral imagery: A comparative study of machine learning algorithms, Remote Sensing, 13, 19, (2021); Guo, Shuze, Urban tourism competitiveness evaluation system and its application: Comparison and analysis of regression and classification methods, Procedia Computer Science, 162, pp. 429-437, (2019); Wu, Jiansheng, A novel hybrid genetic algorithm and Simulated Annealing for feature selection and kernel optimization in support vector regression, pp. 401-406, (2012); Tang, Tianli, Multi-stage deep learning approaches to predict boarding behaviour of bus passengers, Sustainable Cities and Society, 73, (2021); Xia, Guoen, Prediction of logistics demand based on grey neural network ensemble, pp. 358-366, (2017); Wu, Zhauhua, Ensemble empirical mode decomposition: A noise-assisted data analysis method, Advances in Adaptive Data Analysis, 1, 1, pp. 1-41, (2009); Zola, Paola, A Google Trends spatial clustering approach for a worldwide Twitter user geolocation, Information Processing and Management, 57, 6, (2020); Lu, Jing, Influence of transportation network on transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in China, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 129, (2021); Wu, Jiansheng, Support vector regression based on particle swarm optimization and projection pursuit technology for rainfall forecasting, 1, pp. 227-233, (2009)","W.

In this article, a deep learning model is proposed to study the changes in public art landscape pattern in urban space, and it is constantly found that the changes in urban spatial layout have an impact on urban development. Firstly, the landscape index was analyzed effectively, and the Markov model was used to predict land use change, which provided a theoretical basis for the analysis of urban landscape change. Then the GeoSOS-FLUS model based on deep learning is used to make up for the lack of diversity of land use types by using the suitability probability calculation module of ANN and the adaptive inertia and competition mechanism, and the competition between different land use types is introduced. The experimental results show that the GeoSOS-FLUS framework based on deep learning model has good prediction effect and application ability. © 2022 Lei Zhao and Congcong Tang.",,Deep learning; Land use; Markov processes; Arts designs; Design levels; Landscape index; Landscape pattern; Learning models; Markov modeling; Public arts; Spatial layout; Urban development; Urban spaces; Urban growth,,,,,,,"Zhuangshi Chin J Des, (2015); Sharp, Joanne P., Just art for a just city: Public art and social inclusion in urban regeneration, Urban Studies, 42, 5-6, pp. 1001-1023, (2005); Western Leather, (2021); Think Tank Era, (2019); Journal of Hubei University of Technology, (2001); Heffernan, Emma Elizabeth, The relationship between the quality of active frontages and public perceptions of public spaces, Urban Design International, 19, 1, pp. 92-102, (2014); Literary Review, (2006); Jiangxi Building Materials, (2019); Scientia Geographica Sinica, (2003); Acta Montana Sinica, (2000)","L.

However, its performance in calibrating cellular automata (CA) for urban growth simulation has not been investigated. This study compares the MaxEnt model with logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) models to explore its advantages in simulating urban growth and interpreting driving mechanisms. With the land use data of 2000 and 2020 from GlobeLand30, the constructed LR-CA, ANN-CA, SVM-CA, and MaxEnt-CA models are applied to simulate the urban growth of Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan, respectively. Their performance has been evaluated from multiple aspects such as the accuracy of training, testing, and projecting, computational efficiency, simulation accuracy, and simulated urban landscape. The results indicate that the MaxEnt model is superior to the other models except for the computational efficiency, but the time required for the MaxEnt training and projecting is acceptable and far less than that of the SVM. Taking the LR-CA as the benchmark, the kappa coefficients (Kappa) of the MaxEnt-CA have been increased by 4.20%, 3.38%, and 5.87% in Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan, respectively; the increments of corresponding figure of merits (FoM) are 6.26%, 4.58%, and 8.49%. The driving mechanisms of urban growth such as the interactions, response curves, and importance of spatial variables, have also been revealed by the MaxEnt modeling. The driving mechanisms of urban growth in Tianjin are more complex than that in Beijing and Wuhan, because there are more variable interactions; the relationships between spatial factors and urban growth in the three study areas are all nonlinear; the topographic factors and city center of Beijing, the traffic factors and water bodies of Tianjin, and the traffic factors, city center and water bodies of Wuhan are significant factors affecting their urban growth. © 2022 The Author(s).

They should allow authorities to make inter‐city comparisons, considering specific cities and their objects against the background of others undergoing similar development processes. In this article, the authors propose strategic initiatives for the management of urban facilities. In particular, the authors’ approach to the assessment of the sustainable development of housing and communal service facilities in the city is proposed. According to the authors, the housing and communal city service objects mean capital construction objects in different forms of reproduction. Moreover, the article examines both residential buildings and structures, and utility networks. The authors’ approach consists in the constant assessment of the city’s housing and communal service facilities at different stages of their operation. For this, the authors use several types of analysis: ex post analysis, ex ante analysis, and foresight analysis. For each type of analysis, the authors form a set of assessment indicators and indicate the period of the analysis. The result of the study is the development of an indicator for the assessment of the level of sustainable development of housing and communal service facilities in the city, and a roadmap for their development strategy. The roadmap is formed considering the introduction of modern end‐to‐end technologies and digital tools into the work of state bodies. The proposed approach, on the one hand, considers the internal complexity and heterogeneity of the city’s housing and communal service facilities. On the other hand, it is a simple tool for the making of effective management decisions by power structures, as it uses data which are available on a regular basis. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there is a global difference in the composition of this toolkit in the Russian Federation and in foreign countries. This difference is mainly due to the rights of homeowners. In international practice, the priority in making decisions regarding the management of a residential building belongs to the owners [25–30]. These overseas homeowners unite in a non‐profit consumer organization. This organization unites owners of real estate objects or shareholders. This organization’s purpose is to manage the complex of the real estate, and to ensure the operation of this comple and the posses‐ sion, use and disposal of property. The homeowner’s association has become a general‐ izing concept of housing cooperation in various legal forms, such as Planning Unit De‐ velopments, Condominium Associations, and Housing Cooperatives in the United States and Canada; syndicates in France; and apartment joint stock companies in Finland [22,31–33]. In European countries, residents themselves monitor the house condition and re‐ ceive financial support from the authorities. For example, in Germany, France and Hol‐ land, people have the right, in agreement with the municipality, to build (including with the involvement of investors) an object of shared ownership on their land plot, and to save money for overhaul during the operation [28,29,34]. Furthermore, in some countries, there are a state grants system and subsidies for major repairs of houses: they provide the authorities with a project of work, and, if it meets the approved criteria, they receive state aid [29,35–38].; Funding text 2: This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, grant number 075?15?2021?686.

For the latter, urban planners apply a precautionary principle, which is normally not grounded in the actual performance of the urban drainage system (UDS). This approach, however, fails during weather extremes with heavy precipitation. This paper presents a new concept for reducing pluvial flood risks in the urban planning process. The novelty of the developed planning support system named Extreme Weather Layer (EWL) is that it creates dynamic interlinkages between land developments, the performance of UDS, and other factors that contribute to flood risk. The EWL is built on the digital twin of the existing UDS and delivers an easy-to-use concept, where the end user can analyze hydraulic modelling results interlinked with climate scenarios using the GIS platform. This allows planning specialists to consider land use and soil types in the urban environment to simulate the response of the storm water system and the catchments to different rainfall events. This proposed approach was piloted in Haapsalu (Estonia) and Söderhamn (Sweden). The resulting planning support system, which performs as a set of layers within municipalities’ GIS, allows decision makers to understand and predict the impact of various spatial planning decisions on the pluvial flood risk. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous studies have lacked human-oriented technical paths and high-throughput datasets to quantify physical and psychological perceptions in different land-use scenarios. This paper adopts a novel transfer learning approach to quantify the six types of landsense indices (LSIs) as psychological perception metrics and employs panoptic segmentation to parameterize the view index (VI) and the number of foreground instances (NFIs) as physical perception measures. Then, a quantitative analysis is conducted in Beijing's six Ring Road areas, and the connections between people's physical and psychological perceptions of heterogeneous land use are explored. The landsense maps can depict the distribution of LSIs and facilitate the understanding of complex perceptions distributed at a large scale. The regression model shows that natural landscapes (trees, grasses, and mountains) in the Beijing built-up area exhibit an overall positive performance. Moreover, for several block-level land uses, industrial scenery is related to overall negative psychological feelings. Parks and green spaces are positively related to psychological perceptions, because of the greater exposure opportunities to natural landscapes for residents. The framework in this research has potential in assisting urban planning and land-use management, and it enriches the datasets with extensive information, thereby improving the psychological perceptions of urban scenes from residents’ perspectives. The novel approaches in this paper take a step forward in quantifying and understanding the public perceptions of urban landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Cityscapes; Complex perceptions; Deep learning; Human-oriented; Image big data; Massive street-view datasets,data set; greenspace; machine learning; perception; psychology; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Poaceae,,,,,"Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA23030403); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFC0503605); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","All authors dedicate this article to the memory of Prof. Jingzhu Zhao, a great sustainability specialist, leader and mentor.

The effects will depend on the magnitude of projected land use and climate changes and lake sensitivity to these factors. We used random forests fit with long-term (1971–2016) phytoplankton and cyanobacteria abundance time series, climate observations (1971–2016), and upstream catchment land use (global Clumondo models for the year 2000) data from 14 European and 15 North American lakes basins. We projected future phytoplankton and cyanobacteria abundance in the 29 focal lake basins and 1567 lakes across focal regions based on three land use (sustainability, middle of the road, and regional rivalry) and two climate (RCP 2.6 and 8.5) scenarios to mid-21st century. On average, lakes are expected to have higher phytoplankton and cyanobacteria due to increases in both urban land use and temperature, and decreases in forest habitat. However, the relative importance of land use and climate effects varied substantially among regions and lakes. Accounting for land use and climate changes in a combined way based on extensive data allowed us to identify urbanization as the major driver of phytoplankton development in lakes located in urban areas, and climate as major driver in lakes located in remote areas where past and future land use changes were minimal. For approximately one-third of the studied lakes, both drivers were relatively important. The results of this large scale study suggest the best approaches for mitigating the effects of human activity on lake phytoplankton and cyanobacteria will depend strongly on lake sensitivity to long-term change and the magnitude of projected land use and climate changes at a given location. Our quantitative analyses suggest local management measures should focus on retaining nutrients in urban landscapes to prevent nutrient pollution from exacerbating ongoing changes to lake ecosystems from climate change. © 2021 The Authors.

The perceived element for older adults' involvement in the environment differs from the average person. Despite this difference, there is little to no research into understanding how the perceived elements (specifically, the visuospatial configuration) of the environment influence older adults' involvement—most studies focused on younger adults. The focus here is stress, which occurs when environmental demand exceeds a person's capability. As stress impacts a person's involvement in the environment and older adults are more likely to feel stress due to their decline in functional capability, it is important to understand how the visuospatial configuration of urban environment influence stress. Older adults were recruited to participate in an urban environment walk while their physiological responses (Photoplethysmogram) were monitored using wearable sensors. Their perceived stress responses were also collected. Spatial clustering and hot spot analysis were conducted to detect locations with clusters of physiological responses caused by spatial factors. These locations were subsequently labelled as stress or non-stress based on participants' perceived stress. The perceived visual elements of the urban environment were extracted using isovist analysis. Principal component analysis, self-organising map and machine learning algorithms were used to understand the relationship. The results demonstrate that isovist minimum visibility, occlusivity, and isovist area are the most influential determinants of older adults' physiological stress. Older adults prefer urban configurations where they can be seen. This study can be used to inform urban design and planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Isovist analysis; Machine learning; Older adult; Person-environment interaction; Physiological stress; Self-organising map,Data mining; Learning algorithms; Physiological models; Physiology; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Urban planning; Wearable technology; Environment influence; Isovist analysis; Isovists; Older adults; Person-environment interaction; Physiological response; Physiological stress; Population aging; Stress sensing; Urban environments; Machine learning; data mining; elderly population; machine learning; perception; physiological response; urban area,,,,,"Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (PF17-02405); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong through the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme [reference number PF17-02405]; and the Department of Building and Real Estate, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge the Institute of Active Ageing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, in particular, Prof. Daniel W.L.

It also has positive effects on urban vibrancy, public health, and social connections in that community. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the visual quality at the urban street level using street view images. However, the spatial distribution of fine-grained visual quality inside an urban street is rarely investigated. This study presents a new approach for the evaluation of visual quality inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR point clouds. The semantic information of urban streets was first extracted from mobile LiDAR point clouds with a Gradient Boosting classifier. After that, seven well-known key design elements, including the green space factor, sky view factor, enclosure rate, volume index, vehicle occurrence rate, motorization rate, and diversity, were calculated from the classified point clouds using a three-dimensional (3D) visibility model. Finally, the visual quality at 1 m grid resolution inside urban street was achieved automatically by using a random forest model which was trained based on perception samples. This approach has been validated on two study areas and the results indicated that the proposed approach is able to quantitatively examine the visual quality difference inside urban streets. The results generated by the proposed method also match well with the common sense of urban design experts, which are useful for architects and designers to develop best practices in the urban micro-renewal project and to refine the urban planning processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Fine-scale; Machine learning; Mobile LiDAR; Urban street; Visual quality,3D modeling; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Learning systems; Optical radar; Semantics; Urban planning; Fine grained; Fine-scale; Machine-learning; Mobile LiDAR; Point-clouds; Quality distribution; Social connection; Urban community; Urban streets; Visual qualities; Quality control; automation; best management practice; classification; GIS; lidar; machine learning; mobile communication; mobile phone; model validation; public health; quantitative analysis; spatial distribution; three-dimensional modeling; urban area; urban planning; urban renewal; visualization,,,,,"(19YF1413800); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (41871331, 42001357); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021T140207); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42001357 and 41871331 ), the Shanghai Sailing Program (No. 19YF1413800 ), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2021T140207 ).","Tang, Jingxian, Measuring visual quality of street space and its temporal variation: Methodology and its application in the Hutong area in Beijing, Landscape and Urban Planning, 191, (2019); Ye, Yu, The visual quality of streets: A human-centred continuous measurement based on machine learning algorithms and street view images, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 46, 8, pp. 1439-1457, (2019); Handy, Susan L., How the built environment affects physical activity: Views from urban planning, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 23, 2 SUPPL. 1, pp. 64-73, (2002); Frank, Lawrence Douglas, The built environment and human activity patterns: Exploring the impacts of urban form on public health, Journal of Planning Literature, 16, 2, pp. 202-218, (2001); Hankey, Steve, Urban Form, Air Pollution, and Health, Current Environmental Health Reports, 4, 4, pp. 491-503, (2017); Jackson, Richard J.J., Health and the built environment: 10 years after, American Journal of Public Health, 103, 9, pp. 1542-1544, (2013); Jiang, Bin, A dose of nature: Tree cover, stress reduction, and gender differences, Landscape and Urban Planning, 132, pp. 26-36, (2014); Jahani, Ali, Forest landscape visual quality evaluation using artificial intelligence techniques as a decision support system, Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 34, 10, pp. 1473-1486, (2020); Dumbaugh, Eric, Safe urban form: Revisiting the relationship between community design and traffic safety, Journal of the American Planning Association, 75, 3, pp. 309-329, (2009); Middel, Ariane C., Sky View Factor footprints for urban climate modeling, Urban Climate, 25, pp. 120-134, (2018)","J.

Second, a new data fusion strategy was developed to blend DEM data and its derivatives to create a new, fused data source with enriched information content and image features. The model has also enabled deep learning by combining both the proposed data fusion and feature-level fusion strategies to yield a much-improved detection result. Third, two different sets of data augmentation techniques were applied to the multi-source training data to further improve the model performance. A series of experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in multi-source deep learning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Data enrichment; Deep Learning; GeoAI; Multi-source data fusion; Object detection,Convolutional neural networks; Data fusion; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Object recognition; Pipelines; Remote sensing; Surveying; Data enrichments; Deep learning; Digital elevation model data; Feature-level fusions; Features detections; GeoAI; Multi-source data fusion; Multi-Sources; Multisource data; Natural features; Object detection; artificial intelligence; computer simulation; detection method; machine learning; urban design; urban development,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1853864, 2120943); National Science Foundation, NSF",This project is funded in part by the National Science Foundation (Nos. 1853864 and 2120943 ).,"Bay, Herbert, SURF: Speeded up robust features, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3951 LNCS, pp. 404-417, (2006); Dalal, Navneet, Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection, I, pp. 886-893, (2005); Doherty, Patrick, A UAV search and rescue scenario with human body detection and geolocalization, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4830 LNAI, pp. 1-13, (2007); Du, Lin, Multi-modal deep learning for landform recognition, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 158, pp. 63-75, (2019); Evans, Ian S., Geomorphometry and landform mapping: What is a landform?, Geomorphology, 137, 1, pp. 94-106, (2012); Felzenszwalb, Pedro F., A discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable part model, (2008); Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision Eccv, (2018); Girshick, Ross B., Fast R-CNN, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015 International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2015, pp. 1440-1448, (2015); Girshick, Ross B., Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 580-587, (2014); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016)","W.

They tend to explore only the association established between a single factor and the distribution of crime. In order to more accurately and quickly visualize and predict crime distribution in different neighborhoods, and to provide a basis for security planning and design by planning designers, this paper uses GAN neural networks to build a prediction model of city floor plans and corresponding crime distribution maps. We take Philadelphia as the research sample, use more than 2 million crime information of Philadelphia from 2006 to 2018 to draw the crime hotspot distribution map, and collect the corresponding map of Philadelphia, and train the model for predicting the crime rate of the city with more than two thousand sets of one-to-one corresponding images as the training set. When the training is complete, a floor plan can be fed directly to the model, and the model will immediately feed back a hotspot map reflecting the crime distribution. Using the untrained Philadelphia data as the test set, the model can accurately predict crime concentration areas and the predicted crime concentration areas are similar to the concentration areas considered in previous studies. With the feedback from the model, the city layout can be adjusted and the crime rate can be greatly reduced when the simulated city planner tunes into the city plan. In addition the ideas in this paper can be applied as a set of methodologies to predict other relevant urban characteristic parameters and visualize them. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Big data analysis; Crime rate; Machine learning; Urban design,Big data; Floors; Forecasting; Machine learning; Big data analyse; Crime rate; Distribution maps; Floorplans; Hotspots; Neighbourhood; Number of methods; Philadelphia; Urban design; Urban neighborhood; Crime,,,,,,,"Historical Homicide Hot Spots the Case of Three Cities, (2001); Hussein, Heba Adel Ahmed, Crime in relation to urban design.

Though previous studies have examined the effects of various urban features on how much children play and where they play, such studies rely on quantitative measurements of play such as the precise location of play and the duration of play time, while people's subjective feelings regarding the playability of their environment are overlooked. In this study, we capture people's perception of place playability by employing Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to classify street view images. A deep learning model trained on the labelled data is then used to evaluate neighborhood playability for three U.S. cities: Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco. Finally, multivariate and geographically weighted regression models are used to explore how various urban features are associated with playability. We find that higher traffic speeds and crime rates are negatively associated with playability, while higher scores for perception of beauty are positively associated with playability. Interestingly, a place that is perceived as lively may not be playable. Our research provides helpful insights for urban planning focused on sustainable city growth and development, as well as for research focused on creating nourishing environments for child development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Deep learning; Human perception of place; Playability; Street view images,Regression analysis; Urban growth; Amazon mechanical turks; Child development; Childhood development; Geographically weighted regression models; Growth and development; Precise locations; Quantitative measurement; Sustainable cities; Deep learning; artificial intelligence; computer simulation; image analysis; machine learning; smart city; sustainability; urban design; urban development; urban growth; urban planning; Boston; California; Massachusetts; San Francisco [California]; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States],,,,,"Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, WARF; Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison, VCRGE, UW; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41901321, 41971366)","The authors would like to thank the support from the Microsoft AI for Earth Program and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41971366 , 41901321 ) to our study.

This paper outlines the use of a supervised machine learning technique to understand the effects of the urban fabric on surface urban heat island (SUHI) formation in Istanbul, and identify effective variables to provide a basis for research and practice focusing on SUHI mitigation. An analysis using the Ridge Regression Model found that 71% of land surface temperature anomalies in Istanbul are linked to building coverage ratio (BCR), surface/volume ratio (SVR), sky-view factor (SVF), canyon geometry factor (CGF), and vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI and BCR were the urban fabric components with the highest contribution to SUHI formation, while the effects of SVF and CGF remained relatively low. This research can help planners and designers gauge the contribution of the urban fabric to micro-climate issues and adapt SUHI mitigation strategies for projects aiming to build climate-sensitive urban environments. It also provides insight into and improves knowledge of supervised machine learning approaches to the urban planning and design disciplines. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Istanbul; Land surface temperature; Ridge regression model; Surface urban heat island; Urban fabric,Atmospheric temperature; Land surface temperature; Landforms; Supervised learning; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Thermal pollution; Urban planning; Building coverage ratios; Geometry factors; Island formation; Istanbul; Ridge regression model; Sky view factor; Supervised machine learning; Surface urban heat islands; Urban fabrics; Regression analysis; heat island; land surface; machine learning; regression analysis; surface temperature; temperature anomaly; urban design; urban planning; Istanbul [Istanbul (PRV)]; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey,,,,,,"This paper was produced from the PhD dissertation conducted by the corresponding author under the supervision of the second author.

Most developed cities have suffered from severe air quality as population growth and industrialization grow rapidly. Government agencies and citizens are increasingly concerned about air quality, which has an impact on various areas of the human environment and human advancement. Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods. © 2021",Deep learning; Smart City (SC); Smart environment design planning; Statistical model,Air quality; Brain; Forecasting; Population statistics; Quality control; Signal encoding; Smart city; Uncertainty analysis; Autoencoders; Deep learning; Design planning; Environment design; Machine-learning; Short term memory; Smart environment; Smart environment design planning; Statistic modeling; Long short-term memory; air quality; atmospheric pollution; industrialization; machine learning; population growth; smart city; uncertainty analysis; urban design; urban planning,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51808042, 51978058); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","1.National Natural Science Foundation Youth Project, Research on Green Evolution Mechanism and Cooperative Planning Method of “Hollow Village” in Qinba Mountains(51808042)2.the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number(51978058)","Jabareen, Yosef Rafeq, Planning the resilient city: Concepts and strategies for coping with climate change and environmental risk, Cities, 31, pp. 220-229, (2013); Macke, Janaina, Smart city and quality of life: Citizens’ perception in a Brazilian case study, Journal of Cleaner Production, 182, pp. 717-726, (2018); Jegadeesan, Subramani, An efficient anonymous mutual authentication technique for providing secure communication in mobile cloud computing for smart city applications, Sustainable Cities and Society, 49, (2019); Ambituuni, Ambisisi, Analysis of safety and environmental regulations for downstream petroleum industry operations in Nigeria: Problems and prospects, Environmental Development, 9, 1, pp. 43-60, (2014); Sekaran, Kaushik, Smart agriculture management system using internet of things, Telkomnika (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 18, 3, pp. 1275-1284, (2020); Gomathi, P., Concurrent service access and management framework for user-centric future internet of things in smart cities, Complex and Intelligent Systems, 7, 4, pp. 1723-1732, (2021); Sajjad, Muhammad, Raspberry Pi assisted face recognition framework for enhanced law-enforcement services in smart cities, Future Generation Computer Systems, 108, pp. 995-1007, (2020); Mohanty, Saraju P., Everything you wanted to know about smart cities, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, 5, 3, pp. 60-70, (2016); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2011)","Y.

A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4–15 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations. We show that in countries with a high number of post-war neighbourhoods in well-connected locations, considerable densification opportunities could be realised in already built-up residential areas. © 2021 The Author(s)",Archetype; Compact city; Machine learning; Redensification; Urban design; Urban structure unit,Housing; Learning systems; Archetype; Compact city; Densifications; Geo-spatial; Machine-learning; Redensification; Urban design; Urban neighborhood; Urban structure unit; Densification; computer simulation; machine learning; neighborhood; post-war; spatial analysis; urban design; urbanization; Switzerland,,,,,"Bundesamt für Energie, UFE, (SI/501894-01)",This work is supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy under the project StaVerdi (SI/501894-01) .

The satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD), which could represent the concentration of atmospheric particles to a certain extent, is widely used for estimating ambient PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration, in combination with diverse auxiliary information. However, the general satellite-derived PM<inf>2.5</inf> products exhibit limitation in the application and aggregate analysis of PM<inf>2.5</inf> in urban areas, because of the moderate spatial resolution to match the urban landscape and low spatial coverage making it hard to describe airmass trajectory. In order to explore the potential application value of PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration products with relatively high spatial coverage and resolution, a two-stage machine learning and geo-statistics coupled model incorporating with a feedback mechanism was proposed in this study. To be specific, we firstly develop a hybrid back-propagation neural network coupled kriging with external drifting approach (BPNN-KED) for estimating 1-km daily PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration maps at high coverage over four urban agglomerations in China. The model performs well, with R2 up to 0.83 and root mean square error of 14.7 μg/m3 from cross-validation. The daily PM<inf>2.5</inf> maps display an average spatial coverage exceeding 95%, and on an average, each grid produces 350 days of valid estimations annually. In addition, the extra value of the high-coverage PM<inf>2.5</inf> estimates were explored through the more accurate aggregate analysis of urban PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution level. The advantage of the high-coverage PM<inf>2.5</inf> estimation is demonstrated through daily PM<inf>2.5</inf> hotspot identification over urban areas, providing substantially fine spatially resolved PM<inf>2.5</inf> trends, which offers the potential for daily pollutant emission sources location through satellite remote sensing technology. Moreover, the spatiotemporally continuous PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations possess the ability to capture polluted air mass trajectories, thereby offering observational support not only for evaluating the contribution from exogenous pollutants to local PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations and but also for providing empirical references for haze warning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",1-km resolution; Back-propagation neural network; High-coverage; Kriging with external drifting; PM2.5; Urban agglomerations,Aggregates; Backpropagation; Interpolation; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Remote sensing; Satellites; 1-km resolution; Aggregate analysis; Backpropagation neural networks; High-coverage; Kriging; Kriging with external drifting; PM$-2.5$; Spatial coverage; Urban agglomerations; Urban areas; Agglomeration; aerosol composition; ambient air; artificial neural network; back propagation; concentration (composition); estimation method; haze; kriging; optical depth; particulate matter; urban atmosphere; China,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42071353); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFC0212600)","This study was supported financially by the National Key R&D Program of China (Nos. 2017YFC0212600 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42071353 ).

This study proposes an AI and human co-operative evaluation (AIHCE) framework that facilitates communication design between designers and stakeholders based on human emotions and values and is an evaluation method for street space. AIHCE is an evaluation method based on image recognition technology that performs deep learning of the facial expressions of both people and the city; namely, it consists of a facial expression recognition model (FERM) and a street image evaluation model (SIEM). The former evaluates the street space based on the emotions and values of the pedestrian’s facial expression, and the latter evaluates the target street space from the prepared street space image. AIHCE is an integrated framework for these two models, enabling continuous and objective evaluation of space with simultaneous subjective emotional evaluation, showing the possibility of reflecting it in the design. It is expected to contribute to fostering people’s awareness that streets are public goods reflecting the basic functions of public spaces and the values and regional characteristics of residents, contributing to the improvement of the sustainability of the entire city. © 2021 by the authors.

While roadside vegetation barriers can help mitigate TRAP, their effectiveness to reduce TRAP is influenced by site-specific conditions. To test vegetation designs using direct field measurements or high-fidelity numerical simulations is often infeasible since urban planners and local communities often lack the access and expertise to use those tools. There is a need for a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use method to evaluate vegetation barrier designs based on their capacity to mitigate TRAP. In this paper, we investigated five machine learning (ML) methods, including linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and neural networks (NN), to predict size-resolved and locationally dependent particle concentrations downwind of various vegetation barrier designs. Data from 83 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations was used to train and test the ML models. We developed downwind region-specific models to capture the complexity of this problem and enhance the overall accuracy. Our feature space was composed of variables that can be feasibly obtained such as vegetation width, height, leaf area index (LAI), particle size, leaf area density (LAD) and wind speed at different heights. RF, NN, and XGB performed well with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 6–7% and an average test R2 value >0.91, while SVM and LR had an NRMSE of approximately 13% and an average test R2 value of 0.56. Using feature selection, vegetation dimensions and particle size had the highest influence in predicting pollutant concentrations. The ML models developed can help create tools to aid local communities in developing mitigation strategies to address TRAP problems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Air quality; Green infrastructure; Machine learning; Particulate matter (PM); Urban designs; Vegetation,Air pollution; Computational fluid dynamics; Decision trees; Mean square error; Particle size; Roadsides; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Vegetation; Wind; Adverse health effects; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Green infrastructure; Mitigation strategy; Particle concentrations; Pollutant concentration; Root mean square errors; Traffic-related air pollution; Learning systems; accuracy assessment; air quality; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; design; greenspace; infrastructural development; machine learning; numerical model; traffic emission; urban design; vegetation cover; air pollution; article; artificial neural network; computational fluid dynamics; feature selection; leaf area; linear regression analysis; particle size; particulate matter; pollutant; random forest; simulation; support vector machine; vegetation; wind speed,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1605407)",The authors acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through grant no. 1605407 .,"Abhijith, K.

Urban morphological feature extraction and similarity analysis represents a practical framework in many studies to interpret and introduce the current built environment to aid in proposing novel designs. In conventional methods, morphological features are represented based on qualitative descriptions, symbolical interpretation, or manually selected indicators. However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach. We constructed a dataset of 3817 residential plots with geometrical and related infrastructure information. A deep convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet, was implemented with the plots’ figure–ground images, by quantifying the morphological features into 2048-dimensional feature vectors. We conducted a similarity analysis of the plots by calculating the Euclidean distance between the high-dimensional feature vectors. Then, a comparison study was performed by retrieving cases based on the plot shape and plots with buildings separately. The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences. This work could serve as a basis for further typo-morphology studies and other morphology-related ecological, social, and economic studies for sustainable built environments. © 2021 by the authors.

Hyperspectral data are increasingly being considered for exploring levels of urbanization, due to their capability to capture the spectral variability that a modern urban landscape offers. Data and algorithms are two sides of a coin: while the data capture the variations, the algorithms provide suitable methods to extract relevant information. The literature reports a variety of algorithms for extraction of urban information from any given data, with varying accuracies. This article aims to explore the binary-classifier approach to target detection to extract certain features. Roads and roofs are the most common features present in any urban scene. These experiments were conducted on a subset of AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data from the Udaipur region of India, with roads and roofs as targets. Four categories of target-detection algorithms are identified from a literature survey and our previous experience—distance measures, angle-based measures, information measures, and machinelearning measures—followed by performance evaluation. The article also presents a brief taxonomy of algorithms; explores methods such as the Mahalanobis angle, which has been reported to be effective for extraction of urban targets; and explores newer machine-learning algorithms to increase accuracy.

Soil erosion threatens the functioning of urban areas, which was the reason for choosing the territory of the Master Plan of Belgrade (Serbia) as the research area. The calculation of soil erosion loss was analyzed using the G2 erosion model. The model belongs to a group of empirical models and is based on the synthesis of the equation from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Erosion Potential Method (EPM). The estimation of soil degradation was analyzed in two time periods (2001 and 2019), which represent the time boundaries of the management of the Master Plan of Belgrade. The novel approach used in this research is based on using the land cover inventory as a dynamic indicator of the urbanization process. Land cover was identified using remote sensing, machine learning techniques, and the random forest algorithm applied to multispectral satellite images of the Landsat mission in combination with spectral indices. Climatic parameters were analyzed on the basis of data from meteorological stations (first scenario, i.e., 2001), as well as on simulations of changes based on climate scenario RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathways) concerning the current condition of the land cover (second scenario). A comparative analysis of the two time periods identified a slight reduction in total soil loss. For the first period, the average soil loss value is 4.11 t·ha-1·y-1. The analysis of the second period revealed an average value of 3.63 t·ha-1·y-1. However, the increase in non-porous surfaces has led to a change in the focus of soil degradation. Increased average soil loss as one of the catalysts of torrential flood frequencies registered on natural and semi-natural areas were 43.29% and 16.14%, respectively. These results are a significant contribution to the study of soil erosion in urban conditions under the impact of climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

Such analysis becomes challenging for urban networks as their size and complexity are significantly higher compared to other networks. The state-of-the-art machine learning techniques allow us to detect hidden patterns and, thus, infer the features associated with them. However, very little is known about the impact on the performance of such predictive models by the use of different input representations. In this paper, we design and evaluate six different graph input representations (i.e. representations of the network paths), by considering the network’s topological and temporal characteristics, for being used as inputs for machine learning models to learn the behavior of urban network paths. The representations are validated and then tested with a real-world taxi journeys dataset predicting the tips of using a road network of New York. Our results demonstrate that the input representations that use temporal information help the model to achieve the highest accuracy (root mean-squared error of 1.42$). © The Author(s) 2019.",graph learning; path representation; Urban networks,complexity; machine learning; network analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban design; urban development; urban planning; New York [United States]; United States,,,,,"University College London, UCL; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/L006340/1, EP/P016278/1); Alan Turing Institute, (EP/N510129/1)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported through the EPSRC Grants EP/L006340/1 and EP/P016278/1 at UCL and by The Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC Grant EP/N510129/1.","Managing and Mining Graph Data, (2010); Network Flows Theory Algorithms and Applications, (2017); Arun, K., A survey on network path identification using bio inspired algorithms, pp. 387-389, (2016); Bengio, Yoshua, Representation learning: A review and new perspectives, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35, 8, pp. 1798-1828, (2013); Graph Theory with Applications, (1976); undefined, (2016); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, (1958); Applying Graph Theory in Ecological Research, (2017); Graph Theory Graduate Texts in Mathematics, (2005); Dijkstra, E.

And yet, we cannot disregard the most vulnerable elements in the urban landscape: pedestrians, exposed to higher risks than other road users. Indeed, safe, accessible, and sustainable transport systems in cities are a core target of the UN's 2030 Agenda. Thus, there is an opportunity to apply advanced computational tools to the problem of traffic safety, in regards especially to pedestrians, who have been often overlooked in the past. This paper combines public data sources, large-scale street imagery and computer vision techniques to approach pedestrian and vehicle safety with an automated, relatively simple, and universally-applicable data-processing scheme. The steps involved in this pipeline include the adaptation and training of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network to determine a hazard index for each given urban scene, as well as an interpretability analysis based on image segmentation and class activation mapping on those same images. Combined, the outcome of this computational approach is a fine-grained map of hazard levels across a city, and an heuristic to identify interventions that might simultaneously improve pedestrian and vehicle safety. The proposed framework should be taken as a complement to the work of urban planners and public authorities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Google Street View; Mapillary; Pedestrian; Traffic safety,Activation analysis; Computational methods; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Hazards; Image segmentation; Vehicles; Activation mapping; Computational approach; Computational tools; Computer vision techniques; Governmental initiatives; Public authorities; Public data source; Sustainable transport systems; Pedestrian safety; artificial neural network; Internet; machine learning; numerical model; pedestrian; sustainability; transportation development; transportation planning; transportation safety; urban transport,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER; Dirección General de Tráfico, DGT, (RTI2018-095232-B-C22, SPIP2017-02263, TIN2015-66951-C2-2-R); Dirección General de Tráfico, DGT; Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, UOC","All authors acknowledge financial support from the Dirección General de Tráfico (Spain) , Project No. SPIP2017-02263 , as well as TIN2015-66951-C2-2-R and RTI2018-095232-B-C22 grants from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (FEDER funds) .

Also, the level of street greenery is an important indicator of urban environmental quality. However, despite extensive research into environmental assessment methods for urban greenery, plant identification and greenery index calculations are still mostly done manually. In this research, we developed a method based on semantic segmentation processing of street view images to calculate the Green View Index of urban streets, and the Panoramic View Green View Index (PVGVI) is proposed for measuring the visible street-level greenery. We validated the results by comparison with those of manual inspection and the Pyramid Scene Parsing Network method, and found that the proposed method satisfied the accuracy requirements for vegetation detection. In addition, we conducted a case study of street-level greenery using the PVGVI and confirmed that this method can better visualize urban street-level greenery.

This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Change detection index; LST; NDBI; NDVI; Urban heat island; Urban planning,Cell proliferation; Cluster analysis; Decision making; Economic and social effects; K-means clustering; Land surface temperature; Process monitoring; Surface properties; Vegetation; Change detection; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized differences; Spatial analysis; Surface temperatures; Temperature increase; Urban surface temperature; Vegetation cover; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; detection method; heat island; land surface; Landsat; NDVI; surface temperature; urban atmosphere; urban planning; urbanization; Penedono; Portugal; Viseu [Portugal],,,,,"Lowe Syndrome Trust, LST","For an intra-urban scale evaluation, samples from each group were detailed based on high-resolution images, NDVI, NDBI, LST, and CDI changes.

By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Active travel; Deep learning; GIS; Heat vulnerability index (HVI); Sky view factor (SVF); Tree shade,Deep learning; Forestry; Land use; Planning; Population statistics; Adaptation strategies; Geographical area; Health benefits; Learning models; Panorama images; Planning and design; Social-economic; Thermal environment; Sustainable development; comparative study; GIS; heat flow; neighborhood; policy making; satellite imagery; shade tolerance; spatial data; temperature effect; urban design; urban planning; vulnerability; air temperature; Article; canopy; city planning; climate change; controlled study; deep learning; environmental policy; health impact assessment; heat stress; heat tolerance; heat wave; humidity; image segmentation; metabolic rate; physical activity; population density; priority journal; shade; social status; solar radiation; summer; thermal exposure; thermography; travel; urban area; urbanization; Victoria; wind speed; winter,,,,,(SCS59435),"Funding text 1: This research was funded by Australian Smart Cities and Suburbs Program-Smart Active Transport—Urban Heat Maps for Bendigo (SCS59435) and the Clean Air and Urban Landscape Hub funded by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program.

In this study, we objectively measured the seemingly subjective qualities of the eye-level urban landscape perceptions with computer vision and machine learning technologies. We then explored correlations between the measured perceptual qualities and characteristics from the historical context. We chose Berlin as a research object because it is a capital city that owns a rich history of division and reunification, as well as a variety of residential zones built at different periods. We extracted 30 street features from the 150,000 Google Street View Imagery (SVI) dataset with a computer vision algorithm and evaluated eight perceptual qualities including typology, order, ecology, enclosure, aesthetics, richness, accessibility and scale with a machine learning method. Then we defined seven residential districts in Berlin, according to their spatial distributions and construction periods. Through a systematic comparison of perceptual qualities of the seven residential districts, we find perceptual qualities of ecology and enclosure have been improved a lot over a hundred years in Berlin. The housing policies and design codes in different social, economic and political contexts evolved to end overcrowding living conditions, create more open spaces, and develop a better ecological environment. This study enriches our understanding and application of subjective measures of human-centred built environment perception to the evolution of the historical urban landscape. The proposed quantitative framework of subjective human perception measures provides great testimony to evaluate the effects of the implementation of housing and other urban planning policies. Such an automated, multisource, high-throughput and scalable framework can be applied to other cities to determine the personality of the city and assess the impact of urban design and planning policies in streetscape improvement. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH ·.",Computer vision; Google street view image; Machine learning; Perceptual qualities,,,,,,,,"undefined; undefined; Arnold, John David Mc Ewen, Creating a longitudinal, data-driven 3D model of change over time in a postindustrial landscape using GIS and CityEngine, Journal of Cultural Heritage Management and Sustainable Development, 8, 4, pp. 434-447, (2018); Bernet, Claus, The 'Hobrecht plan' (1862) and Berlin's urban structure, Urban History, 31, 3, pp. 400-419, (2004); Bentlin, Felix, Understanding the Hobrecht Plan.

This may indicate average variation in plant growth over large urban landscape (community gardens, green corridor etc). Towards this direction, this short technical note explores development of a simple automated machine learning program that can accurately segregate colors from plant leaves. In this newly developed program, a machine learning algorithm has been modified and adapted to give the proportion of different colors present in a leaf. Python script is developed for an image processing. For validation, experiments are conducted in green house to grow Axonopus compressus. Script first extracts different RGB (Red Green and Blue) colors present in the leaf using the K-means clustering algorithm. Appropriate centroids required for the clusters of leaf colors are formed by the K-means algorithm. The new program provides saves computation time and gives output in form of different colors proportion as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. This study is the first step towards the demonstration of using automated programs for the segregation of colors from the leaf in order to access the growth of the plant in an urban landscape. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",Data-informed urban design; Greenway planning; Machine learning algorithms; Multi-sourced urban data,anthropogenic effect; data set; detection method; GIS; greenspace; integrated approach; machine learning; species diversity; strategic approach; urban design; urban ecosystem; urban planning; China; Guangdong; Maoming,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (20ZR1462200); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51708410, 52078343); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (2020010102); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Tongji University","We would like to express our appreciation for the editor and three anonymous reviewers for the time and effort you have taken to provide such insightful guidance.

Notably, the urban heat island phenomenon is becoming more prominent in megacities and their hinterlands in temperate and subtropical climatic regions. In the daytime in summer, there exists a high possibility of accelerating the land surface temperature (LST) in desert cities, due to the alterations made by human beings in the natural environment. In this study, we investigate the spatial formation of LST in a tropical sub-Saharan city of Accra, a gateway to West Africa, using Landsat data in 2003 and 2017. Machine learning techniques and the different spatial and statistical methods such as tasseled cap transformation (TCT), urban-rural gradient, and multiresolution grid-based and landscape metrics were employed to examine procured land use/cover (LUC) and LST maps. LUC was classified into five categories: Built up, Green 1, Green 2, Bare land, and Water. The results of the analysis indicate that Built up, Green 2, and Bare land had caused the highest heating effect while Green 1 and Water had caused the considerable cooling effect during the daytime in Accra.

This research aims to discern the success of sustainability planning by examining and comparing the different characteristics of UHIs through the combination of machine learning and statistical methods. To achieve this, we analyze 4 new towns in Korea, which include two ‘old’ new towns and two ‘recent’ new towns. The key difference between our test towns lies on whether or not the sustainability policies were applied to their development plans. We visualize LST and conduct a k-mean clustering to find and quantify spatial patterning in the resulting UHI measures. We then compare the statistical relations between LST and 6 UHI driven variables across the towns. Using comparative analysis, this research reveals that sustainable development policies have a notable effect on the patterns and intensities of UHI. Urban structures, planned under development policies, including green and blue space ratios, road networks, and housing distributions, were found to affect UHI significantly. We quantifiably confirm that the sustainability policies implemented in planning the ‘recent’ new towns allow the towns to experience less aggravated UHIs than the ‘old’ new towns. However, we also claim a need to develop appropriate, long-term UHI management regulations for the ‘recent’ new towns.

This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity. These findings hold implications for urban planning and water distribution design to mitigate potential cascading failures. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Complexity; Interdependency; Transportation networks; Urban morphology; Water distribution networks,Decision trees; Morphology; Topology; Water supply systems; Connectivity profile; Failure propagation; Network connectivity; Random forest modeling; Topological connectivity; Transportation interface; Transportation system; Water distributions; Urban transportation; prediction; transportation system; urban design; urban morphology; urban planning; water supply,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1638301)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1638301.

In this area, it is impacted by the fungal pathogen Diplodia sapinea, which causes a tip blight and canker on infected trees. While the disease can be managed through the application of fungicides and/or by preventing environmental conditions that are favorable for the pathogen, these practices only temporarily alleviate the problem. A more sustainable solution is to use resistant trees. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric analysis can distinguish between trees that vary in susceptibility to D. sapinea. Trees were phenotyped for resistance to D. sapinea by artificially inoculating shoots and measuring ensuing lesions seven days following inoculation. Then, three different chemometric approaches, including a type of machine learning called support vector machine (SVM), were used to evaluate whether or not trees that varied in susceptibility could be distinguished. Trees that varied in susceptibility could be discriminated based on FT-IR spectra collected prior to pathogen infection using the three chemometric approaches: soft independent modeling of class analogy, partial least squares regression, and SVM. While further validation of the predictive models is needed, the results suggest that the approach may be useful as a tool for screening and breeding Austrian pine for resistance to D. sapinea. Furthermore, this approach may have wide applicability in other tree/plant pathosystems of concern and economic value to the nursery and ornamental industries. © 2020 International Society of Arboriculture",Diplodia sapinea; Diplodia tip blight; FT-IR; Pinus nigra; Predictive modeling,computer simulation; forest management; FTIR spectroscopy; fungal disease; machine learning; model validation; pathogen; phenotype; pine; Midwest; United States,,,,,,,"Abdel-Rahman, Elfatih Mohamed, Detecting Sirex noctilio grey-attacked and lightning-struck pine trees using airborne hyperspectral data, random forest and support vector machines classifiers, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 88, pp. 48-59, (2014); Barnes, Ralph J., Standard normal variate transformation and de-trending of near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectra, Applied Spectroscopy, 43, 5, pp. 772-777, (1989); Blodgett, James T., Effects of moderate water stress on disease development by Sphaeropsis sapinea on red pine, Phytopathology, 87, 4, pp. 422-428, (1997); Blodgett, James T., Sphaeropsis sapinea and water stress in a red pine plantation in Central Wisconsin, Phytopathology, 87, 4, pp. 429-434, (1997); I.

The use of these typologies and finding similarities and dissimilarities between cities enables better targeted interventions for improved health, transport, and environmental outcomes in urban areas. A better understanding of local contexts can also assist in applying lessons learned from other cities. Constructing urban typologies at a global scale through traditional methods, such as functional or network analysis, requires the collection of data across multiple political districts, which can be inconsistent and then require a level of subjective classification. To overcome these limitations, we use neural networks to analyse millions of images of urban form (consisting of street view, satellite imagery, and street maps) to find shared characteristics between the largest 1692 cities in the world. The comparison city of Paris is used as an exemplar and we perform a case study using two Australian cities, Melbourne and Sydney, to determine if a “Paris-end” of town exists or can be found in these cities using these three big data imagery sets. The results show specific advantages and disadvantages of each type of imagery in constructing urban typologies. Neural networks trained with map imagery will be highly influenced by the structural mix of roads, public transport, and green and blue space. Satellite imagery captures a combination of both urban form and decorative and natural details. The use of street view imagery emphasises the features of a human-scaled visual geography of streetscapes. However, for both satellite and street view imagery to be highly effective, a reduction in scale and more aggressive pre-processing might be required in order to reduce detail and create greater abstraction in the imagery. © 2020 by the authors.",health; machine learning; transport; urban design; urban typology,,,,,,"National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (APP1136250); University of Melbourne, UNIMELB","This project was made possible thanks to computer hardware purchased by the Transportation, Health, and Urban Design (THUD) Research Lab at the University of Melbourne.

However, as a high-density city, Macau’s limited urban space must cope with the growing population and the arrival of an aging society. In the existing studies, less attention has been paid to Macau, especially the relationship between Macanese elderly and urban space. This study uses Baidu Street View (BSV) on the Macau Peninsula and conducts field surveys to obtain street view data to evaluate the openness, greenness, interface coverage, and road area ratio of street space and its association with the physical and mental health of the elderly and social health. The results show that the data truly reflect the overall street space conditions on the Macau Peninsula. The street openness, greenery rate, and interface enclosure are all related to the elderly in various evaluations in areas with a higher population dependency index and aging index. Human space perception is related to health gain, and road area ratio is weaker than other indicators. The research results have certain policy implications and have practical significance for city managers and designers. © 2020 by the authors.

They also facilitate new methods of analyzing the built environment, ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to crowdsourced citizen participation. Digital representations of cities have become so refined that they challenge our perception of the real. However, computers have not yet become able to detect and analyze the visible features of built structures depicted in photographs or other media. Recent scientific advances mean that it is possible for this new field of computer vision to serve as a critical aid to research. Neural networks now meet the challenge of identifying and analyzing building elements, buildings and urban landscapes. The development and refinement of these technologies requires more attention, simultaneously, investigation is needed in regard to the use and meaning of these methods for historical research. For example, the use of AI raises questions about the ways in which computer-based image recognition reproduces biases of contemporary practice. It also invites reflection on how mixed methods, integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches, can be established and used in research in the humanities. Finally, it opens new perspectives on the role of crowdsourcing in both knowledge dissemination and shared research. Attempts to analyze historical big data with the latest methods of deep learning, to involve many people—laymen and experts—in research via crowdsourcing and to deal with partly unknown visual material have provided a better understanding of what is possible. The article presents findings from the ongoing research project ArchiMediaL, which is at the forefront of the analysis of historical mediatizations of the built environment. It demonstrates how the combination of crowdsourcing, historical big data and deep learning simultaneously raises questions and provides solutions in the field of architectural and urban planning history. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",Artificial intelligence; Automated image content recognition; Big data; Computer vision; Crowdsourcing; Image repositories; Urban heritage,,,,,,,,"Tu Delft News, (2017); P7003algorithmic Bias Considerations, (2017); Alloa, Emmanuel, Iconic turn: A plea for three turns of the screw, Culture, Theory and Critique, 57, 2, pp. 228-250, (2016); Amato, Giuseppe, Fast image classification for monument recognition, Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage, 8, 4, (2015); Andrianaivo, Louis Nantenaina, ARCHITECTURE RECOGNITION by MEANS of CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 42, 2/W15, pp. 77-84, (2019); Image Matching Crowdsourcing Tool, (2020); Assemblage, (1987); Fabricating Architecture Selected Readings in Digital Design and Manufacturing, (2012); Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research, (2007); Bauhausideen Bibliographie Und Beitrage Zur Rezeption Des Bauhausgedankens Bauhaus Ideas Bibliography and Contributions on the Reception of the Bauhaus Idea, (1994)","T.

Reality, one of the most important elements in virtual reality technology, means visual expression so that a person can experience three-dimensional space like reality. To obtain this realism, real-world data are used in the various fields. For example, in order to increase the realism of 3D modeled building textures real aerial images are utilized in 3D modelling. However, the aerial image captured during the day can be shadowed by the sun and it can cause the distortion or deterioration of image. To resolve this problem, researches on detecting and removing shadows have been conducted, but the detecting and removing shadow is still considered as a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting and removing shadows using deep learning. For this work, we first a build a new dataset of photo-realistic synthetic urban data based on the virtual environment using 3D spatial information provided by VWORLD. For detecting and removing shadow from the dataset, firstly, the 1-channel shadow mask image is inferred from the 3-channel shadow image through the CNN. Then, to generate a shadow-free image, a 3-channel shadow image and a detected 1-channel shadow mask into the GAN is executed. From the experiments, we can prove that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in detecting and removing shadow. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

However, when it comes to measuring the built density, a difficulty has been observed in defining valid measurement indicators universally. With the intention of identifying the variables that allow the best characterization of the shape of urban fabrics and of obtaining the metrics of their density, a multi-variable analysis methodology from the field of artificial intelligence is proposed. The main objective of this paper was to evaluate the capacity and interest of such a methodology from standard indicators of the built density, measured at various urban scales, (i) to cluster differentiated urban profiles in a robust way by assessing the results statistically, and (ii) to obtain the metrics that characterize them with an identity. As a case study, this methodology was applied to the state of the art European urban fabrics (N = 117) by simultaneously integrating 13 regular parameters to qualify urban shape and density. It was verified that the profiles obtained were more robust than those based on a limited number of indicators, evidencing that the proposed methodology offers operational opportunities in urban management by allowing the comparison of a fabric with the identified profiles. © 2019 by the authors.

The advent of machine learning and data mining techniques have geared the problem from simple analysis of data to knowledge discovery from data. This work attempts to mine urban landscapes to find the change pattern which has happened over the region for a period of interest. The work proposes a spatiotemporal-metric miner, which uses the spatial, temporal and landscape metric data to discover the change that has occurred in a region. The model works on a hierarchical basis, wherein, the regions of interest are chosen in a landscape and are aggregated to find the change that has happened over the entire region. The entire model is built by taking advantage of the tensorized representation of data, and thus resulting in the effective mining of tensors. The growth of a landscape is evaluated regarding two parameters, namely, Inter-class Growth Index and Intra-class Growth Index. Experiments are performed on the landscape regions of Indian cities, and a ranking of cities is presented based on the growth indices, which are validated against standards. In the experiments, Jaipur city showed the highest Inter-class Growth Index value of 2.68 and Surat city had an Intra-class Growth Index of 0.78. © 2019, Korean Spatial Information Society.",Change detection; Data mining; Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal mining,Change detection; Remote sensing; Tensors; Factorization approach; Growth indices; Inter class; Intra class; Remote-sensing; Research challenges; Spatio-temporal minings; Tensor factorization; Urban landscape; Data mining,,,,,,,"Acker, James G., Online analysis enhances use of NASA Earth Science Data, Eos, 88, 2, pp. 14-17, (2007); Hwang, Do-hyun, Study of the temporal and spatial analysis by using SST satellite data, International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, 11, 12, pp. 149-160, (2016); Liu, Xiaoping, Simulating urban growth by integrating landscape expansion index (LEI) and cellular automata, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 28, 1, pp. 148-163, (2014); Park, Soyoung, Prediction and comparison of urban growth by land suitability index mapping using GIS and RS in South Korea, Landscape and Urban Planning, 99, 2, pp. 104-114, (2011); Vakalopoulou, Maria, Building detection in very high resolution multispectral data with deep learning features, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2015-November, pp. 1873-1876, (2015); Albert, Adrian, Using convolutional networks and satellite imagery to identify patterns in urban environments at a large scale, Part F129685, pp. 1357-1366, (2017); Hu, Tengyun, Mapping urban land use by using landsat images and open social data, Remote Sensing, 8, 2, (2016); Lang, Stefan Christian, Landscape metrics – a toolbox for assessing past, present and future landscape structures, pp. 207-234, (2008); Tewkesbury, Andrew P., A critical synthesis of remotely sensed optical image change detection techniques, Remote Sensing of Environment, 160, pp. 1-14, (2015); Alphan, Hakan, Post-classification comparison of land cover using multitemporal Landsat and ASTER imagery: The case of Kahramanmaras, Turkey, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 151, 1-4, pp. 327-336, (2009)","S.

For centuries, understanding these places has been limited to sporadic observations and laborious data collection. This study proposes a novel methodology to analyze citywide, discrete urban spaces using highly accurate anonymized telecom data and machine learning algorithms. Through superposition of human dynamics and urban features, this work aims to expose clear correlations between the design of the city and the behavioral patterns of its users. Geolocated telecom data, obtained for the state of Andorra, were initially analyzed to identify “stay-points”—events in which cellular devices remain within a certain roaming distance for a given length of time. These stay-points were then further analyzed to find clusters of activity characterized in terms of their size, persistence, and diversity. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify associations between the formation of these clusters and various urban features such as urban morphology or land-use within a 25–50 meters resolution. Some of the urban features that were found to be highly related to the creation of large, diverse and long-lasting clusters were the presence of service and entertainment amenities, natural water features, and the betweenness centrality of the road network; others, such as educational and park amenities were shown to have a negative impact. Ultimately, this study suggests a “reversed urbanism” methodology: an evidence-based approach to urban design, planning, and decision making, in which human behavioral patterns are instilled as a foundational design tool for inferring the success rates of highly performative urban places. © The Author(s) 2019.",human dynamics; machine learning; spatial analysis; telecom data; Urban design,decision making; machine learning; telecommunication; temporal record; urban design; urban development; urban morphology; urban planning,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT","This study would not be possible without the collaboration between MIT and the State of Andorra.

With the help of recently emerged street view images and machine learning algorithms, an evaluation model has been trained to assess the perceived visual quality with accuracy similar to that of experienced urban designers, to provide full coverage and detailed results for a citywide area. The town centre of Shanghai was selected for the site. Around 140,000 screenshots from Baidu Street View were processed and a machine learning algorithm, SegNet, was applied to intelligently extract the pixels representing key elements affecting the visual quality of streets, including the building frontage, greenery, sky view, pedestrian space, motorisation, and diversity. A Java-based program was then produced to automatically collect the preferences of experienced urban designers on representative sample images. Another machine learning algorithm, i.e. an artificial neural network, was used to train an evaluation model to achieve a citywide, high-resolution evaluation of the visual quality of the streets. Further validation through different approaches shows this evaluation model obtains a satisfactory accuracy. The results from the artificial neural network also help to explore the high or low effects of various key elements on visual quality. In short, this study contributes to the development of human-centred planning and design by providing continuous measurements of an ‘unmeasurable’ quality across large-scale areas. Meanwhile, insights on the perceptual-based visual quality and detailed mapping of various key elements in streets can assist in more efficient street renewal by providing accurate design guidance. © The Author(s) 2019.",machine learning; street; Street view images; urban design; visual quality,accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; guideline; image analysis; image resolution; machine learning; mapping method; pixel; quantitative analysis; urban design; China; Shanghai,,,,,,,"Badrinarayanan, Vijay, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); undefined, (2015); City Sense and City Design Writings and Projects of Kevin Lynch, (1990); Bargh, John A., Automaticity of Social Behavior: Direct Effects of Trait Construct and Stereotype Activation on Action, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, 2, pp. 230-244, (1996); undefined, (2014); undefined, (2016); Doersch, Carl, What makes paris look like Paris?, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 31, 4, (2012); Rating of Chess Players Past and Present, (1978); Ewing, Reid H., Measuring the unmeasurable: Urban design qualities related to walkability, Journal of Urban Design, 14, 1, pp. 65-84, (2009); AI Expert, (1991)","Y.

The relationships between urban design parameters and multiple performance should be stipulated to evaluate scenarios for supporting timely and reliable design decisions. However, there are three major challenges: (1) only a few design alternatives are devised, (2) the multiple performance has not been provided synthetically, and (3) the relationships between design parameters and performance are difficult to be determined because they are multivariate relationships. This research proposes a new methodology applying a generative design approach using a reinforcement learning algorithm, a parametric performance modeling, and a multivariate adaptive regression splines approach to identify relationships between design parameters and urban performance. This research aims to support decision-making of urban design to achieve an energy efficient and visually qualified urban environment. A data-driven urban design approach is proposed to generate possible design alternatives using reinforcement learning, and a design-driven analysis is conducted to evaluate multiple performance of urban buildings using parametric modeling. The multivariate analysis presented relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria by using 30 samples. The findings show that to maintain optimal solar potential, the building coverage ratio is recommended to be bigger than 0.17. To maintain the optimal energy balance, the threshold for sky view factor is recommended as 54.17%. These relationships contribute to deriving design strategies and guidelines for designing a sustainable campus. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Data-driven design; Design-driven energy and visibility performance; Generative design; Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS); Parametric modeling; Reinforcement learning,Decision making; Energy efficiency; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multivariant analysis; Building coverage ratios; Data-driven design; Generative design; Multi variate analysis; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Parametric modeling; Parametric performance; Performance criterion; Reinforcement learning; building; design method; methodology; modeling; multivariate analysis; parameter estimation; solar radiation; urban design; urban region,,,,,,,"undefined; undefined, (2013); undefined, (2018); Pérez-Lombard, Luis, A review on buildings energy consumption information, Energy and Buildings, 40, 3, pp. 394-398, (2008); Nutkiewicz, Alex, Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S): A framework for integrating engineering simulation and machine learning methods in a multi-scale urban energy modeling workflow, Applied Energy, 225, pp. 1176-1189, (2018); Nutkiewicz, Alex, Energy modeling of urban informal settlement redevelopment: Exploring design parameters for optimal thermal comfort in Dharavi, Mumbai, India, Applied Energy, 231, pp. 433-445, (2018); undefined, (1977); Yang, Xiaoshan, An integrated simulation method for building energy performance assessment in urban environments, Energy and Buildings, 54, pp. 243-251, (2012); Quan, Steven Jige, Urban form and building energy performance in Shanghai neighborhoods, Energy Procedia, 88, pp. 126-132, (2016); Quan, Steven Jige, A GIS-based Energy Balance Modeling System for Urban Solar Buildings, Energy Procedia, 75, pp. 2946-2952, (2015)","P.P.-J.

However, to date, most of the previous studies have largely focused on the use of coarse- or moderate-resolution data, with which it may not be possible to identify the land-use classes in urban environments. Due to the improved spatial details, high-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery provides us with an opportunity for the semantic interpretation of urban landscapes. Therefore, in this study, we took the City of Shenzhen (1997 km2) in China as an example to assess the detailed land-use change and its effect on ecosystem services (ESs), based on HR satellite data from 2005 to 2017. In particular, deep learning was used to obtain accurate land-use maps, because this technique is able to model the hierarchical representations of features and can thus effectively characterize urban scenes. The results revealed the following findings: (a) The overall accuracy of the proposed approach was 96.9% and 97.1% for 2005 and 2017, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art semantic classification models; (b) residential and commercial areas in Shenzhen increased dramatically over the study period by 10,416 and 9,168 ha, at the expense of ecological land; (c) supply capacity of the ecosystem decreased by 13.7%, but demand for ESs showed an increase of 23.5%. By courtesy of HR images, detailed land-use changes and the associated ESs can be monitored, which facilitates the in-depth understanding of urban environmental systems. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ecosystem service; land degradation; land-use development; urban environment; urbanization,Ecosystems; Image enhancement; Land use; Remote sensing; Semantics; Urban planning; Ecosystem services; Hierarchical representation; High-resolution remotely sensed imageries; Land degradation; Semantic classification; Semantic interpretation; Urban environments; urbanization; Deep learning; accuracy assessment; ecosystem service; environmental monitoring; land degradation; land use change; learning; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (2017CFA029, 41771360); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","Funding text 1: Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017CFA029; National Program for Support of Top‐notch Young Professionals; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41771360; Funding text 2: dation of China under Grant 41771360, the National Program for; Funding text 3: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foun-","Abulizi, Abudukeyimu, Land-Use Change and its Effects in Charchan Oasis, Xinjiang, China, Land Degradation and Development, 28, 1, pp. 106-115, (2017); Ayanu, Yohannes Zergaw, Quantifying and mapping ecosystem services supplies and demands: A review of remote sensing applications, Environmental Science and Technology, 46, 16, pp. 8529-8541, (2012); Journal of Natural Resources, (2000); Bai, Yang, Developing China’s Ecological Redline Policy using ecosystem services assessments for land use planning, Nature Communications, 9, 1, (2018); Burkhard, Benjamin, Mapping ecosystem service supply, demand and budgets, Ecological Indicators, 21, pp. 17-29, (2012); Cakir, Günay, Evaluating urbanization, fragmentation and land use/land cover change pattern in Istanbul city, Turkey from 1971 to 2002, Land Degradation and Development, 19, 6, pp. 663-675, (2008); Chen, Kouping, Multivariate statistical evaluation of trace elements in groundwater in a coastal area in Shenzhen, China, Environmental Pollution, 147, 3, pp. 771-780, (2007); Technical Specification for Updating the Second National Land Survey Database, (2007); World Cities Report 2016, (2016); Chuai, Xiaowei, Land degradation monitoring using terrestrial ecosystem carbon sinks/sources and their response to climate change in China, Land Degradation and Development, 29, 10, pp. 3489-3502, (2018)","X.

The most distinctive elements in the urban landscape - categorised in paths, nodes, edges, districts and landmarks - give shape to individuals’ mental representation of the city. Lynch's approach has stimulated research into spatial cognition, urban design and artificial intelligence, and it still represents an essential pillar in the analysis of urban dynamics. Nevertheless, an explicit link between The Image of the City and GIScience has not been completely explored yet. In this paper, a computational approach to The Image of the City is proposed. Different perspectives in spatial cognition and GIS research are integrated to obtain a complete Image of the City, in which the most salient elements are shared by a large part of citizens. Nodes, paths and districts were identified through network science techniques. Methods drawn from the information approach to The Image of the City are used to detect landmarks, integrating the complexity of points of reference in their visual, structural and semantic components, as conceptualised by Lynch and successive research. The methods were applied to the central area of Boston and built using freely available spatial datasets. Results were compared to Lynch's maps to evaluate the methodology: besides a considerable discrepancy with regard to landmarks, a good correspondence for paths, nodes, edges and districts was found. © 2019 The Authors",Cognitive maps; GIScience; Image of the City; Kevin Lynch; Street network,GIS; mapping; numerical model; public space; urban area; urban design,,,,,,,"Appleyard, Donald, Why buildings are known: A Predictive Tool for Architects and Planners, Environment and Behavior, 1, 2, pp. 131-156, (1969); Environment and Planning B, (1979); Blondel, Vincent, Fast unfolding of communities in large networks, Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2008, 10, (2008); undefined, (2017); Cooper, Crispin H.V., Spatial localization of closeness and betweenness measures: a self-contradictory but useful form of network analysis, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 29, 8, pp. 1293-1309, (2015); Couclelis, Helen M., Exploring the anchor-point hypothesis of spatial cognition, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 7, 2, pp. 99-122, (1987); Proceedings of the 4th International Space Syntax Symposium, (2003); Mind and Maze Spatial Cognition and Environmental Behavior, (2001); Elias, Birgit, Extracting landmarks with data mining methods, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2825, pp. 375-389, (2003); 5th International Space Syntax Symposium, (2005)","G.

However, most studies so far have focused on only few features, such as street greenery or accessibility. These features fail to capture people’s holistic perceptions. The potential of fine grained, multi-sourced urban data creates new research avenues for addressing multi-feature, intangible, human-oriented issues related to the built environment. This study proposes a systematic, multi-factor quantitative approach for measuring street quality with the support of multi-sourced urban data taking Yangpu District in Shanghai as case study. This holistic approach combines typical and new urban data in order to measure street quality with a human-oriented perspective. This composite measure of street quality is based on the well-established 5Ds dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Destination accessibility and Distance to transit. They are combined as a collection of new urban data and research techniques, including location-based service (LBS) positioning data, points of interest (PoIs), elements and visual quality of street-view images extraction with supervised machine learning, and accessibility metrics using network science. According to these quantitative measurements from the five aspects, streets were classified into eight feature clusters and three types reflecting the value of street quality using a hierarchical clustering method. The classification was tested with experts. The analytical framework developed through this study contributes to human-oriented urban planning practices to further encourage physical activity and public health. © 2019 by the author.

To this end, we estimated statistical models that fused multi-temporal very fine spatial (20 cm) and vertical (1 mm) resolution imagery, that captures the complexity of urban vegetation, with remotely sensed temperature data to assess how urban vegetation configuration influences urban temperatures. Perth, Western Australia, was used as a case-study for this analysis. Panel regression models showed that within a location an increase in tree and shrub cover has a larger cooling effect than grass coverage. On average, holding all else equal, an approximate 1 km 2 increase in shrub (tree) cover within a location reduces surface temperatures by 12 °C (5 °C). We included a range of robustness checks for the observed relationships between urban vegetation type and temperature. Geographically weighted regression models showed spatial variation in the cooling effect of different vegetation types; this indicates that i) unobserved factors moderate temperature-vegetation relationships across urban landscapes, and ii) that urban vegetation type and temperature relationships are complex. Machine learning models (Random Forests) were used to further explore complex and non-linear relationships between different urban vegetation configurations and temperature. The Random Forests showed that vegetation type explained 31.84% of the out-of-bag variance in summer surface temperatures, that increased cover of large vegetation within a location increases cooling, and that different configurations of urban vegetation structure can lead to cooling gains. The models in this study were trained with vegetation data capturing local detail, multiple time-periods, and entire city coverage. Thus, these models illustrate the potential to develop locally-detailed and spatially explicit tools to guide planning of vegetation configuration to optimise cooling at local- and city-scales. © 2018",Geographically weighted regression (GWR); Land surface temperature (LST); Machine learning; Urban heat island (UHI); Urban vegetation,"Artificial intelligence; Cooling; Decision trees; Forestry; Learning systems; Location; Regression analysis; Surface properties; Vegetation; Geographically weighted regression; Geographically weighted regression models; Land surface temperature; Non-linear relationships; Perth , Western Australia; Remotely sensed temperature; Urban heat island; Urban vegetation; Atmospheric temperature; cooling; geostatistics; heat island; land surface; machine learning; surface temperature; urban design; urban planning; vegetation; article; geographically weighted regression; grass; heat; human; human experiment; landscape; nonhuman; random forest; shrub; summer; Western Australia; city; climate; Embryophyta; growth, development and aging; physiology; season; temperature; theoretical model; Australia; Perth [Western Australia]; Cities; Climate; Hot Temperature; Models, Theoretical; Seasons; Temperature",,,,,,,"undefined, (2016); Angrist, Joshua D., Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricist's companion, (2008); Banerjee, Mousumi M., Identifying representative trees from ensembles, Statistics in Medicine, 31, 15, pp. 1601-1616, (2012); Bounoua, Lahouari, Impact of urbanization on US surface climate, Environmental Research Letters, 10, 8, (2015); Urban Monitor Enabling Effective Monitoring and Management of Urban and Coastal Environments Using Digital Aerial Photography Final Report Transformation of Aerial Photography into Digital Raster Information Product, (2012); Cai, Ruohong, Estimating the spatially varying responses of corn yields to weather variations using geographically weighted panel regression, Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 39, 2, pp. 230-252, (2014); Carleton, Tamma A., Social and economic impacts of climate, Science, 353, 6304, (2016); Chun, B., Spatial statistical analysis and simulation of the urban heat island in high-density central cities, Landscape and Urban Planning, 125, pp. 76-88, (2014); Climate Change Science and Solutions for Australia, (2011); Clinton, Nicholas Etienne, MODIS detected surface urban heat islands and sinks: Global locations and controls, Remote Sensing of Environment, 134, pp. 294-304, (2013)","J.M.A. Duncan; UWA School of Agriculture and Environment, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia; email: john.duncan@uwa.edu.au",,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,30504014,English,Sci.

Conventional approaches to control energy efficiency of buildings mainly focus on materials and capacity of insulation, but rarely consider urban and building geometries. By examining energy impacts on urban blocks by urban geometric forms, this paper seeks to identify urban geometric types and energy patterns on urban blocks. To achieve the aims of this study, this paper follows two steps: First, significant indicators for analyzing energy performance are identified in urban geometries; second, the types that capture urban geometry of a real city are categorized. As a result, as a reference for urban planning and design, the paper identifies 13 types that represent the characteristics of urban geometries regarding energy performance.

Understanding these perceptions may be useful to inform the design, management and planning process of public spaces. Recently, several studies have used data collected at a massive scale and machine learning methods to quantify these perceptions, showing promising results in terms of predictive performance. Nevertheless, most of these models can be of little help in understanding users’ perceptions due to the difficulty associated with identifying the importance of each attribute of landscapes. In this work, we propose a novel approach to quantify perceptions of landscapes through discrete choice models, using semantic segmentations of images of public spaces, generated through machine learning algorithms, as explanatory variables. The proposed models are estimated using the Place Pulse dataset, with over 1.2 million perceptual indicators, and are able to provide useful insights into how users perceive the built environment as a function of its features. The models obtained are used to infer perceptual variables in the city of Santiago, Chile, and show they have a significant correlation with socioeconomic indicators. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Discrete choice models; Machine learning; Perceptions; Public spaces,Image segmentation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Semantics; Sensory perception; Discrete choice models; Explanatory variables; Machine learning methods; Predictive performance; Public space; Semantic segmentation; Socio-economic indicators; Subjective perceptions; Learning algorithms; discrete choice analysis; machine learning; perception; performance assessment; planning process; prediction; public space; segmentation; urban design; Chile; Metropolitana,,,,,"Volvo Research and Educational Foundations, VREF; Instituto de Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería, ISCI, (FBO16); Instituto de Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería, ISCI; Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, CEDEUS, (CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020); Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, CEDEUS","This research was partially funded by the Complex Engineering Systems Institute , ISCI (ICM: P-05-004-F, CONICYT:FBO16), the Centre for Sustainable Urban Development , CEDEUS (CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020), and the BRT + Centre of Excellence funded by the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations ( VREF ).","Adler, Philip D.F., Auditing black-box models for indirect influence, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, 0, pp. 1-10, (2016); Transprtation Research Part A Policy and Practice, (1995); undefined, (2015); Proceedings of the 3rd Swiss Transportation Research Conference, (2003); Bollen, Kenneth Alan, Latent variables in psychology and the social sciences, Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 605-634, (2002); Bonaiuto, Marino, Indexes of perceived residential environment quality and neighbourhood attachment in urban environments: A confirmation study on the city of Rome, Landscape and Urban Planning, 65, 1-2, pp. 41-52, (2003); Borsboom, Denny, The Theoretical Status of Latent Variables, Psychological Review, 110, 2, pp. 203-219, (2003); Brostow, Gabriel J., Semantic object classes in video: A high-definition ground truth database, Pattern Recognition Letters, 30, 2, pp. 88-97, (2009); Cañas-Guerrero, Ignacio, A contribution to the assessment of scenic quality of landscapes based on preferences expressed by the public, Land Use Policy, 26, 4, pp. 1173-1181, (2009); Canny, John F., A Computational Approach to Edge Detection, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, PAMI-8, 6, pp. 679-698, (1986)",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,1692046,,LUPLE,,English,Landsc.

This study bridges in-situ observations of pedestrian activity and urban computing by integrating high-resolution, large-scale, and heterogeneous urban datasets and analyzing both fixed attributes of the urban landscape (e.g. physical and transit infrastructure) with dynamic environmental and socio-psychological factors, such as weather, air quality, and perceived crime risk. We use local pedestrian count data collected by the New York City (NYC) Department of Transportation (DOT) and an extensive array of open datasets from NYC to test how pedestrian volumes relate to land use, building density, streetscape quality, transportation infrastructure, and other factors typically associated with urban walkability. We quantify, classify, and analyze place dynamics, including contextual and situational factors that influence pedestrian activity at high spatial–temporal resolution. The quantification process measures the urban context by extracting rich, yet initially fragmented and siloed, urban data for individual geolocations. Based on these features, we then construct contextual indicators by selecting and combining features relevant to pedestrian activity, and develop a typology of place to support the generalizability of our analysis. Finally, we use multivariate regression models with panel-corrected standard errors to estimate how specific contextual features and time-varying situational indicators impact pedestrian activity across time of day, day of the week, season, and year. The results provide insights into the key drivers of local pedestrian activity and highlight the importance accounting for the immediate urban environment and socio-spatial dynamics in pedestrian behavior modeling. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Pedestrian mobility; Urban computing; Urban data; Urban planning; Walkability,Air quality; Bridges; Economics; Land use; Large dataset; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Regression analysis; Urban planning; Department of Transportation; Multivariate regression models; Pedestrian behavior model; Pedestrian mobility; Transportation infrastructures; Urban computing; Urban data; Walkability; Urban transportation; data set; landscape; machine learning; pedestrian; quantitative analysis; urban area; urban design; urban ecosystem; urban planning; urban transport; walking; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States,,,,,,,"A Pattern Language Towns Buildings Construction, (1977); Aultman-Hall, Lisa, Assessing impact of weather and season on pedestrian traffic volumes, Transportation Research Record, 2140, pp. 35-43, (2009); undefined, (1998); Beck, Nathaniel L., What to do (and not to do) with time-series cross-section data, American Political Science Review, 89, 3, pp. 634-647, (1995); Social Education, (1994); European Transport Conference, (2016); Brown, Barbara B., Mixed land use and walkability: Variations in land use measures and relationships with BMI, overweight, and obesity, Health and Place, 15, 4, pp. 1130-1141, (2009); Brownson, Ross C., Measuring the Built Environment for Physical Activity.

Nevertheless, it remains difficult to obtain accurate and timely ULC information. This study presents a methodological framework for fusing optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at the pixel level with manifolds to improve ULC classification. Three typical manifold learning models, namely, ISOMAP, Local Linear Embedding (LLE) and principle component analysis (PCA), were employed, and their results were compared. SPOT-5 data were used as optical data to be fused with three different SAR datasets. Experimental results showed that 1) the most useful information of the optical and SAR data were included in the manifolds with intrinsic dimensionality, while various ULC classes were distributed differently throughout the feature spaces of manifolds derived from different learning methods; 2) in certain cases, ISOMAP performed comparably to PCA, but PCA generally performed the best out of all the study cases, yielding the best producer's and user's accuracy of all ULC classes and requiring the least amount of time to build the machine learning models; and 3) the LLE-derived manifolds yielded the lowest accuracy, primarily by confusing bare soils with dark impervious surfaces and vegetation. These results indicate the effectiveness of the new manifold technology to fuse optical and SAR data at the pixel level for improving ULC classification, which can be applied in practice to support the accurate analysis of urban landscape. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Manifold learning; Multisource data fusion; Optical and SAR; Urban land covers,Data fusion; Ecology; Pixels; Synthetic aperture radar; Intrinsic dimensionalities; Manifold learning; Methodological frameworks; Multisource data; Optical and SAR; Principle component analysis; Urban land cover; Urban land cover classification; Learning systems; accuracy assessment; experimental study; land classification; land cover; landscape ecology; learning; optical method; principal component analysis; radar; satellite data; urban area,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41401370); Ministry of Education, MOE; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (14601515, 14635916, CUHK 14605917); Fuzhou University, FZU, (2016LSDMIS02)","This study was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41401370 ), the Research Grants Council (RGC) General Research Fund ( CUHK 14601515 , CUHK 14635916 and CUHK 14605917 ), the Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining & Information Sharing of Ministry of Education , Fuzhou University (No. 2016LSDMIS02 ) and the Major Special Project-the China High-Resolution Earth Observation System .

However, insufficient weather stations limit accurate spatial representation of temperature within a heterogeneous city. This study used a random forest machine learning approach to estimate daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (T<inf>max</inf> and T<inf>min</inf>) for two megacities with different climate characteristics: Los Angeles, USA, and Seoul, South Korea. This study used eight time-series land surface temperature (LST) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with seven auxiliary variables: elevation, solar radiation, normalized difference vegetation index, latitude, longitude, aspect, and the percentage of impervious area. We found different relationships between the eight time-series LSTs with T<inf>max</inf>/T<inf>min</inf> for the two cities, and designed eight schemes with different input LST variables. The schemes were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 10-fold cross-validation. The best schemes produced R2 of 0.850 and 0.777 and RMSE of 1.7 °C and 1.2 °C for T<inf>max</inf> and T<inf>min</inf> in Los Angeles, and R2 of 0.728 and 0.767 and RMSE of 1.1 °C and 1.2 °C for T<inf>max</inf> and T<inf>min</inf> in Seoul, respectively.

However, there is almost no information about how urban landscapes shape transmission dynamics in wildlife. Using an innovative phylodynamic approach combining host and pathogen molecular data with landscape characteristics and host traits, we untangle the complex factors that drive transmission networks of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in bobcats (Lynx rufus). We found that the urban landscape played a significant role in shaping FIV transmission. Even though bobcats were often trapped within the urban matrix, FIV transmission events were more likely to occur in areas with more natural habitat elements. Urban fragmentation also resulted in lower rates of pathogen evolution, possibly owing to a narrower range of host genotypes in the fragmented area. Combined, our findings show that urban landscapes can have impacts on a pathogen and its evolution in a carnivore living in one of the most fragmented and urban systems in North America. The analytical approach used here can be broadly applied to other host–pathogen systems, including humans. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",bobcat; disease biology; feline immunodeficiency virus; fragmentation; machine learning; phylodynamics,"animal; Bayes theorem; biological model; California; ecosystem; Feline immunodeficiency virus; gene flow; genetics; Lentivirus infection; Lynx; molecular evolution; phylogeny; spatial analysis; transmission; urbanization; virology; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Bayes Theorem; Ecosystem; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Flow; Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline; Lentivirus Infections; Los Angeles; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Spatial Analysis; Urbanization","GENBANK: JN383436:JN383465, JN383436, JN383465",,,,"(EF 0723676/DEB 1413925); Division of Environmental Biology, DEB, (DEB 1413925); Division of Environmental Biology, DEB; University of Minnesota, UM","Funding text 1: This project was funded by two National Science Foundation Ecology of Infectious Diseases research programme grants (EF 0723676/DEB 1413925).

Next to traditional, patch-based metrics used in landscape ecology, alternative metrics are proposed, measuring the presence and the spatial arrangement of built-up and open space areas along a set of radial transects, along contours parallel to the urban block boundary and along the block's perimeter, as well as metrics describing the internal composition of the built-up area. Use of the proposed metrics for identifying different types of urban form and function was tested on the Brussels Capital Region. Large-scale vector data was used to define built-up structures and to analyse the morphological properties of the built-up area at block level. Decision tree classification was applied in conjunction with bootstrap aggregation to gain insight in the distinctive character of the defined metrics, and the robustness of land use and urban form classification based on these metrics. Our study points out the shortcomings of traditional landscape ecological metrics for mapping urban form and emphasizes the need for alternative approaches for analysing urban landscapes, more explicitly describing the morphological characteristics of the urban fabric. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Brussels Capital Region; Land use; Machine learning; Spatial metrics; Urban form; Urban function,Decision trees; Ecology; Land use; Learning systems; Mapping; Brussels Capital Region; Decision tree classification; Internal composition; Morphological characteristic; Morphological properties; Spatial arrangements; Spatial metrics; Urban form; Structures (built objects); analytical method; building; land use; landscape ecology; machine learning; mapping; open space; spatial analysis; transect; urban area; urban design; urban morphology; Belgium; Brussels [Belgium],,,,,,,"Barnsley, Michael J., Distinguishing urban land-use categories in fine spatial resolution land-cover data using a graph-based, structural pattern recognition system, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 21, 3-4, pp. 209-225, (1997); Sustainable Urban and Regional Planning the Moland Activities on Urban Scenario Modelling and Forecast, (2003); Urban Building Blocks, (2008); Canters, Frank, Land-use simulation as a supporting tool for flood risk assessment and coastal safety planning: The case of the Belgian coast, Ocean and Coastal Management, 101, PB, pp. 102-113, (2014); Cavalli, Rosa Maria, Hyperspectral sensor data capability for retrieving complex urban land cover in comparison with multispectral data: Venice city case study (Italy), Sensors, 8, 5, pp. 3299-3320, (2008); Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest, (2009); Lu, Dengsheng, Impervious surface mapping with quickbird imagery, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 32, 9, pp. 2519-2533, (2011); undefined, (2008); undefined, (2014); Heiden, Uta, Urban structure type characterization using hyperspectral remote sensing and height information, Landscape and Urban Planning, 105, 4, pp. 361-375, (2012)","S.

Applying three suitability layers of environmental risk (soil erosion, flood risk, fire risk, and land susceptibility), urbanization potential, and integrated surface (environmental risk plus urbanization potential layers), a non-path-dependent Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-MC) model was configured to execute three scenarios of polycentric urban growth allocation. Specifically, the modeling approach improved the traditional functionality of the CA-MC model from a prediction algorithm into an innovative land allocation tool. Besides, due to its flexibility, the non-path-dependent model was able to explicitly include different characteristics of the landscape structure ranging from physical land attributes to landscape functions and processes (natural hazards). Accordingly, three polycentric urban growth allocation efforts were undertaken and compared in terms of connectivity and compactness of the resultant patterns and consumption of other land resources. Based on results, the polycentric allocation procedure based on integrated suitability layer produced a more manageable pattern of urban landscape, while the growth option based on environmental risk layer was more successful for protecting farmlands against excessive urbanization. This study suggests that polycentric urban land-use planning under the strategy of rural land development programs is an available option for designing an urban landscape with lower exposure to natural hazards and more economic benefits to rural residents. Finally, the non-path-dependent modeling is a recommended approach, when highly flexible and interactive decision-support systems as well as trend-breaking scenarios are desired. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Cellular Automata-Markov Chain model; Environmental risk management; Iran; Non-path-dependent modeling; Polycentric urban land-use planning; Urban growth modeling,Artificial intelligence; Cellular automata; Chains; Decision support systems; Economics; Environmental management; Floods; Hazards; Land use; Markov processes; Risk management; Risk perception; Structure (composition); Environmental risk managements; Iran; Markov chain models; Urban growth modeling; Urban land use; Urban growth; cellular automaton; environmental management; environmental risk; land use planning; Markov chain; risk assessment; urban area; urban growth; urbanization; agricultural land; decision support system; exposure; human; landscape; physical model; prediction; risk management; rural area; rural population; soil erosion; algorithm; city planning; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; fire; flooding; geographic mapping; risk; spatiotemporal analysis; Golestan; Gorgan; Algorithms; City Planning; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Geographic Mapping; Markov Chains; Risk; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Urbanization,,,,,,,"Adab, Hamed, Modeling forest fire risk in the northeast of Iran using remote sensing and GIS techniques, Natural Hazards, 65, 3, pp. 1723-1743, (2013); Afrakhteh, Roshanak, Evaluating the strategy of integrated urban-rural planning system and analyzing its effects on land surface temperature in a rapidly developing region, Habitat International, 56, pp. 147-156, (2016); Environmental Futures the Practice of Environmental Scenario Analysis, (2008); Jabbarian Amiri, Bahman, Introducing landscape accuracy metric for spatial performance evaluation of land use/land cover change models, Geocarto International, 32, 11, pp. 1171-1187, (2017); Antrop, Marc, Landscape change and the urbanization process in Europe, Landscape and Urban Planning, 67, 1-4, pp. 9-26, (2004); Asgarian, Ali, Assessing the effect of green cover spatial patterns on urban land surface temperature using landscape metrics approach, Urban Ecosystems, 18, 1, pp. 209-222, (2015); Brown, Daniel G., Path dependence and the validation of agent-based spatial models of land use, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 19, 2, pp. 153-174, (2005); Burby, Raymond J., Creating hazard resilient communities through land-use planning, Natural Hazards Review, 1, 2, pp. 99-106, (2000); Carruthers, John I., The American Way of Land Use: A Spatial Hazard Analysis of Changes Through Time, International Regional Science Review, 35, 3, pp. 267-302, (2012); Clarke, Keith C., A self-modifying cellular automaton model of historical urbanization in the San Francisco Bay area, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 24, 2, pp. 247-261, (1997)","Y.

These decisions can be assisted by different approaches ranging from linear depreciation for estimating the economic value of the network over using a deterioration model to assess the probability of failure or the technical service life to sophisticated multi-criteria decision support systems. Subsequently, the aim of this paper is to compare five available multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods (ELECTRE, AHP, WSM, TOPSIS, and PROMETHEE) for the application in an integrated rehabilitation management scheme for a real world case study and analyze them with respect to their suitability to be used in integrated asset management of water systems. The results of the different methods are not equal. This occurs because the chosen score scales, weights and the resulting distributions of the scores within the criteria do not have the same impact on all the methods. Independently of the method used, the decision maker must be familiar with its strengths but also weaknesses. Therefore, in some cases, it would be rational to use one of the simplest methods. However, to check for consistency and increase the reliability of the results, the application of several methods is encouraged. © 2017 by the authors.",AHP; Asset management; Decision support; ELECTRE; Multi-utility rehabilitation; PROMETHEE; TOPSIS; Urban water infrastructure; WSM,Artificial intelligence; Asset management; Decision support systems; Hierarchical systems; Scales (weighing instruments); Water management; Decision supports; Electre; PROMETHEE; TOPSIS; Urban waters; Decision making; decision making; decision support system; distribution system; future prospect; infrastructure; integrated approach; multicriteria analysis; prioritization; urban design; urban planning; water management; water planning; water supply,,,,,,,"European Standard En 752 Drain and Sewer Systems Outside Buildings, (2008); European Standard En 805 Water Supply Requirements for Systems and Components Outside Buildings, (2000); Casillas, Myrna V., Optimal sensor placement for leak location in water distribution networks using evolutionary algorithms, Water (Switzerland), 7, 11, pp. 6496-6515, (2015); Sörensen, Johanna Lykke, Re-thinking urban flood management-time for a regime shift, Water (Switzerland), 8, 8, (2016); Care S Computer Aided Rehabilitation of Sewer and Storm Water Networks, (2006); Yoo, Do Guen, Rehabilitation priority determination of water pipes based on hydraulic importance, Water (Switzerland), 6, 12, pp. 3864-3887, (2014); Osman, Hesham M., Coordination of urban infrastructure reconstruction projects, Structure and Infrastructure Engineering, 12, 1, pp. 108-121, (2016); Tscheikner-Gratl, Franz, Integrated rehabilitation planning of urban infrastructure systems using a street section priority model, Urban Water Journal, 13, 1, pp. 28-40, (2016); Tscheikner-Gratl, Franz, Integrated rehabilitation management by prioritization of rehabilitation areas for small and medium sized municipalities, pp. 2045-2057, (2015); Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras, State of art surveys of overviews on MCDM/MADM methods, Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 20, 1, pp. 165-179, (2014)","F.

In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and ""interpretability"". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of ""regional centers"" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs.

The recent advances in sensor technologies and digitization have produced a wealth of data to help research activities by facilitating improved measurements and conducting large scale analysis. This paper explores the potential of big data and big data analytics in the light of current approaches to measuring streetscape features. By applying machine learning algorithms on Google Street View imagery, we generated objectively three measures on visual enclosure. The results showed that sky areas were identified fairly well for the calculation of proportion of sky. The three visual enclosure measures were found to be correlated with pedestrian volume and Walk Score. This method allows large scale and consistent objective measures of visual enclosure that can be done reproducibly and universally applicable with readily available Google Street View imagery in many countries around the world to help test their association with walking behaviors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Enclosure; Machine learning; Street design features; Walkability,algorithm; data set; machine learning; satellite imagery; travel behavior; walking; World Wide Web,,,,,,,"Badland, Hannah M., Can virtual streetscape audits reliably replace physical streetscape audits?, Journal of Urban Health, 87, 6, pp. 1007-1016, (2010); Boer, Rob, Neighborhood Design and Walking Trips in Ten U.S. Metropolitan Areas, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 32, 4, pp. 298-304, (2007); Urban Design Reader, (2007); Clarke, Philippa J., Using Google Earth to conduct a neighborhood audit: Reliability of a virtual audit instrument, Health and Place, 16, 6, pp. 1224-1229, (2010); Measuring Urban Design Qualities an Illustrated Field Manual, (2005); Applied Multiple Regression Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1983); Proceedings 3rd International Space Syntax Symposium, (2001); Duncan, Dustin T., Validation of Walk Score® for estimating neighborhood walkability: An analysis of four US metropolitan areas, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 8, 11, pp. 4160-4179, (2011); Ewing, Reid H., Travel and the built environment, Journal of the American Planning Association, 76, 3, pp. 265-294, (2010); Ewing, Reid H., Measuring urban design: Metrics for livable places, pp. 1-183, (2013)","L.

When infested by the RPW, all untreated palms typically die. RPW monitoring is difficult, and when the pest is detected, management to save the infested palm becomes intricate. For this reason, an efficient and integrated RPW monitoring, such as a location-aware system (LAS), combined with the scientific knowledge of experts on the palm's physiology and the RPW biological cycle must be designed, developed and implemented. In the current study, an innovative integrated RPW management in urban landscapes under real conditions is presented. Based on the LAS, this study investigates the effectiveness of monitoring RPW infestations in palms, such as the Phoenix canariensis, under field conditions at the Pedion Areos park, which is located in central Athens, the capital of the Hellenic Republic. The goal of this study is to address the specific needs of RPW management and control by facilitating the treatment process adopted by experts combined with an appropriate spatial decision support system (SDSS), which accounts for the RPW population dynamics and spatio-temporal characteristics of the infested areas. The process of estimating the infestation risk is based on a ten-point scale classification, which is incorporated into the LAS. The results from the aforementioned moderate-scaled field experiment conducted for evaluation purposes showed that the LAS is an innovative, simple, and easy to use integrated platform that can be used for early detection, rapid monitoring and assessment of RPW in urban landscapes. Finally, the results from this four-year experiment showed that the diameter and height of the trunk of canary palms play a significant role in the susceptibility to RPW infestations and the recovery of infested canary palms; the results also demonstrated that control of RPW in urban landscapes is possible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Location-aware system; Mobile GIS; Red palm weevil; Spatial decision support system,Animals; Artificial intelligence; Risk perception; Integrated management; Location aware system; Management and controls; Mobile GIS; Red palm weevil; Scientific knowledge; Spatial decision support systems; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Decision support systems; beetle; decision support system; GIS; integrated approach; invasive species; pest control; population dynamics; urban system; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece; Coleoptera; Curculionidae; Phoenix canariensis; Rhynchophorus ferrugineus,,,,,"(289566); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (FP7 KBBE 2011-5-289566)",This research received funding from the European Community\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement No. FP7 KBBE 2011-5-289566 (PALM PROTECT).,"Cohen, Yafit, Spatial decision support system for Medfly control in citrus, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 62, 2, pp. 107-117, (2008); undefined; Dembilio, Óscar, Basic bio-ecological parameters of the invasive Red Palm Weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in phoenix canariensis under mediterranean climate, Bulletin of Entomological Research, 101, 2, pp. 153-163, (2011); Dembilio, Óscar, Bio-ecology and integrated management of the red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in the region of Valencia (Spain), Hellenic Plant Protection Journal, 5, 1, pp. 1-12, (2012); Dynamic Mobile GIS Investigating Change in Space and Time, (2006); Bulletin Oepp EPPO Bulletin, (2008); Esrigis Mapping Software Solutions Services Map Apps and Data; International Journal of Tropical Insect Science, (2006); Faleiro, Jose Romeno, Spatial distribution of red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Oliv.

As in all eddy covariance studies, obtaining annual sums of urban CO<inf>2</inf> exchange requires imputation of data gaps due to low turbulence and non-stationary conditions, adverse weather, and instrument failures. Gap-filling approaches that are widely used for measurements from towers in natural vegetation are based on light and temperature response models. However, they do not account for key features of the urban environment including tower footprint heterogeneity and localized CO<inf>2</inf> sources. Here, we present a novel gap-filling modeling framework that uses machine learning to select explanatory variables, such as continuous traffic counts and temporal variables, and then constrains models separately for spatially classified subsets of the data. We applied the modeling framework to a three year time series of measurements from a tall broadcast tower in a suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA. The gap-filling performance was similar to that reported for natural measurement sites, explaining 64% to 88% of the variability in the fluxes. Simulated carbon budgets were in good agreement with an ecophysiological bottom-up study at the same site. Total annual carbon dioxide flux sums for the tower site ranged from 1064 to 1382gCm-2yr-1, across different years and different gap-filling methods. Bias errors of annual sums resulting from gap-filling did not exceed 18gCm-2yr-1 and random uncertainties did not exceed ±44gCm-2yr-1 (or ±3.8% of the annual flux). Regardless of the gap-filling method used, the year-to-year differences in carbon exchange at this site were small. In contrast, the modeled annual sums of CO<inf>2</inf> exchange differed by a factor of two depending on wind direction. This indicated that the modeled time series captured the spatial variability in both the biogenic and anthropogenic CO<inf>2</inf> sources and sinks in a reproducible way. The gap-filling approach developed here may also be useful for inhomogeneous sites other than urban areas, such as logged forests or ecosystems under disturbance from fire or pests. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Carbon dioxide; Eddy covariance; Gap-filling; Machine learning; Spatial heterogeneity; Uncertainty; Urban ecosystem,Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Filling; Learning systems; Random errors; Time series; Towers; Eddy covariance; Gap filling; Spatial heterogeneity; Uncertainty; Urban ecosystem; Urban growth; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; disturbance; ecophysiology; eddy covariance; error analysis; heterogeneity; source-sink dynamics; spatial variation; uncertainty analysis; urban ecosystem; Article; carbon footprint; error; explanatory variable; landscape; machine learning; seasonal variation; time; time series analysis; United States; urban area; Minneapolis; Minnesota; Saint Paul,,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,"Earth Sciences Division, (NNG04GN80G); Earth Sciences Division","The KUOM flux study was funded by a grant to J.P.M. from NASA Earth Science Division ( NNG04GN80G ), as a component of the North American Carbon Program (NACP).

The formulation of spatial indicators helps identify the ecological, socio-economic and urban characteristics of the case-study area, along with their historic evolution over a specific time period. Time History Analysis (THA) enables the identification of permanent elements and transformations along with the relationships among the various urban landscape components over time.

The fragmentation of urban landscape and built-in facilities may leave less large scale open spaces for developing patchy forests and green spaces. Therefore, the urban tree canopy is one of the best indictors for quantitively and qualitively assessing urban forest characteristics thus a primary measure for urban forest planning and management. As a result, many communities are adopting Urban tree canopy (UTC) goals to maintain and improve forest benefits. UTC is defined as precentage of the leaves, branches and stems of trees that cover the ground when viewed from above. It is therefore widely used for evaluating water quality improvement, energy saving, urban heat island mitigation, air pollution reduction, property values adding, wildlife habitat conservation, social and educational opportunities, and aesthetic benefits that urban tree and forest can provide. UTC is relatively easy to measure by remote sensing technology and less costly than field sampling. UTC is a comparable index across a city and among cities whatever the size of the area is measured. In addition, UTC is a good performance measure for detecting changes across space and time and an easy-to-understand concept for communicating between managers and the public. The present development of UTC studies and applications can be summarized as 1) the UTC researches have firmly related with the eco-construction,people's living and city management, 2) the high resolution images are broadly utilizated in UTC investigation and maping, 3) the Object-Based Image Analysis method and LIDAR technology are being applicated in the UTC research, and 4) the assistant artificial intelligence decision-making system will be popularized in the UTC construction and management.",Status and trend; Urban forest; Urban tree canopy (UTC),decision making; forest management; greenspace; habitat conservation; lidar; remote sensing; urbanization,,,,,,,"Antrop, Marc, Changing patterns in the urbanized countryside of Western Europe, Landscape Ecology, 15, 3, pp. 257-270, (2000); World Urbanization Prospects the 1996 Revision, (1998); World Urbanization Prospects the 2007 Revision, (2008); China Park, (2004); Journal of Arid Land Resources and Environment, (2006); Su, Weizhong, Ecological land fragmentation and its connectivity with urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta, Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica, 62, 12, pp. 1309-1317, (2007); Urban Environment and Urban Ecology, (2010); Cook, Edward A., Urban landscape networks: An ecological planning framework, Landscape Research, 16, 3, pp. 7-15, (1991); Nadenicek, Daniel Joseph, Nature in the city: Horace Cleveland's aesthetic, Landscape and Urban Planning, 26, 1-4, pp. 5-15, (1993); Mazzotti, Frank J., A scientific framework for managing urban natural areas, Landscape and Urban Planning, 38, 3-4, pp. 171-181, (1997)","B.

We know only little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis. In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can support the bees. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Citizen science; Solitary bees; Spatial distribution; Sun exposure; Trap nest; Urban landscape structure,Ecosystems; Logistic regression; Spatial distribution; Citizen science; Solitary bees; Sun exposures; Trap nest; Urban landscape; Urban growth; abundance; artificial nest; bee; biotope; GIS; habitat selection; habitat type; pollination; regression analysis; resource availability; spatial distribution; trap (equipment); urban area; wild population; Germany; Leipzig; Saxony; Apoidea; Hymenoptera; Megachilidae; Osmia; Osmia rufa,,,,,"European Commission, EC, (FP6-036921, GOCE-CT-2003-506675); Helmholtz Association, (VH-NG 247)","We thank the participating volunteers for trap-nest placing and returning and for completing the questionnaire.

Remote sensing can reveal spatio-temporal growth trajectories of cities, which again allow a thorough understanding of the impacts of urbanization on ecosystems and ecosystem services. However, the mapping of urban areas remains one of the most challenging tasks of remote sensing data analysis. This paper presents an approach to map urban growth from multi-sensoral data, exemplified for the Dhaka megacity region in Bangladesh between 1990 and 2006. The approach is globally applicable and can facilitate regional urban growth maps in arbitrary complex and dynamic environments. Dhaka's densified urban landscape, its deltaic locality and the highly dynamic monsoon-related phenology call for a sophisticated analysis approach that is able to separate intra-annual land-cover variations from actual urbanization. Imagery from the Landsat series of satellites is a great asset for such an analysis due to its synoptic coverage of large urban areas as well as its unique historical archives. In our approach, we solve problems of spectral ambiguities and seasonal phenological dynamics through incorporating multi-temporal imagery for each monitoring year (1990, 2000, and 2006) and by extending the spectral feature space with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The resulting datasets are heterogeneous and comprise measurements of unequal scaling. Non-parametric classification algorithms are required to delineate multi-modal and non-Gaussian class distributions of heterogeneous as well as temporally and spectrally complex land-cover classes of interest in such an extended feature space. We therefore used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and post classification comparison to reveal spatio-temporal patterns of urban land-use and land-cover changes. An SVM based forward feature selection procedure allowed deriving in-depth information about the individual contribution of different input bands. Our methodology delineated relevant land-cover classes and resulted in overall accuracies better than 83% for all years considered. Change analysis unveiled a profound expansion of urban areas at the expense of prime agricultural areas and wetlands. During the 1990s, change was primarily characterized by a densification of urban fabric, whereas more recent changes included vast in-filling of low lying land and an extensive industrial sprawl into Dhaka's peri-urban areas. Our multi-sensoral and multi-temporal mapping approach allowed for delineating temporally dynamic LULCC, which again allowed for an insightful characterization of land system changes in the megacity region of Dhaka. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In previous studies in this context statistical methods such as variance analysis and regression analysis are the most used techniques, and these suffer from the limitations of large sample sizes and rigorous statistical assumptions. However, the rough sets approach, as a nonparametric method of artificial intelligence, can handle this problem. In this study, twenty civil-engineering students and twenty noncivil-engineering students took part in an image preference survey assessing photographs of sidewalks. Then the rough sets approach was conducted by a four-step procedure to analyze the survey results. Finally, the output of the rough sets approach is used to express people's perception of good and bad features of sidewalk space. The results will hopefully help planners to make effective decisions about sidewalk features. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.",,artificial intelligence; pedestrian; perception; public space; urban design,,,,,,,"Nijkamp, Peter J., Time pioneers and travel behavior: An investigation into the viability of 'slow motion, Growth and Change, 30, 2, pp. 237-263, (1999); Düntsch, Ivo, Uncertainty measures of rough set prediction, Artificial Intelligence, 106, 1, pp. 109-137, (1998); van Egmond, Patrick W., A comparative analysis of the performance of urban public transport systems in Europe, International Social Science Journal, 55, 176, pp. 235-247, (2003); Ergin, Ayşen, A new methodology for evaluating coastal scenery: Fuzzy logic systems, Area, 36, 4, pp. 367-386, (2004); Rise of the Creative Class, (2002); Frank, Lawrence Douglas, Linking land use with household vehicle emissions in the central puget sound: Methodological framework and findings, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 5, 3, pp. 173-196, (2000); Health and Community Design the Impact of the Built Environment on Physical Activity, (2003); Fukahori, Kiyotaka, The role of design elements on the cost-effectiveness of streetscape improvement, Landscape and Urban Planning, 63, 2, pp. 75-91, (2003); Operational Tools in the Management of Financial Risks, (1998); undefined","M.
